# Follow Up After No-Show

## Purpose
Execute proven no-show follow-up sequences that recover lost opportunities and convert no-shows into rescheduled calls and sales.

## When to Use
- Prospect doesn't show up to scheduled call
- Prospect joins but leaves within first minute
- Prospect cancels last minute
- Prospect reschedules multiple times
- Prospect goes dark after booking

## Core Philosophy

**A no-show is not a lost lead - it's an opportunity to demonstrate value and rebuild commitment.**

Most businesses give up after one follow-up email. Elite operators have systematic sequences that recover 30-50% of no-shows.

Your job: Make rescheduling the path of least resistance while rebuilding urgency and commitment.

## The No-Show Psychology

**Why People No-Show:**
1. Forgot (poor reminder system)
2. Lost interest (value not clear)
3. Got busy (not urgent enough)
4. Got cold feet (fear/hesitation)
5. Already solved problem elsewhere
6. Never serious (tire-kicker)

**Your Response Must:**
- Not guilt trip or shame
- Rebuild value and urgency
- Make rescheduling frictionless
- Give them an out (respectfully)
- Set deadline for response

## The Complete No-Show Sequence

### Immediate Response (Within 5 Minutes of Start Time)

The prospect didn't join at start time. Give them 5 minutes, then send:

#### SMS 1: Immediate Check-In

```
"Hey [First Name] - looks like we missed each other.

I'm here for the next 10 minutes if you can still join: [Link]

If something came up, no worries - just reschedule here: [Reschedule Link]

- [Your Name]"
```

**Key Elements:**
- Calm tone (no guilt)
- Still available NOW (immediate option)
- Easy reschedule (path of least resistance)
- Sign your name (personal)

**Why It Works:**
- Catches people who forgot or were running late
- Shows you're flexible
- No pressure, just option

#### Email 1: Immediate Follow-Up

```
Subject: "We missed you"

Hey [First Name],

Looks like something came up for our [Time] call today.

No worries - stuff happens.

If you can still make it in the next few minutes, I'm here: [Link]

Otherwise, grab a new time here: [Reschedule Link]

Or if you'd rather not reschedule, just let me know and I'll close your file.

[Your Name]
[Phone]
[Company]
```

**Key Elements:**
- Understanding (not accusatory)
- Three options (join now / reschedule / opt out)
- Easy paths for all three
- Phone number (shows accessibility)

---

### Follow-Up #2: 2 Hours Later

They didn't respond immediately. Try again:

#### SMS 2: Value Reminder

```
"[First Name] - still want to solve [their problem from form]?

I had some ideas ready for you.

Grab a new time: [Link]

- [Your Name]"
```

**Key Elements:**
- Remind them of THEIR problem (why they booked)
- Tease value ("I had ideas")
- Simple reschedule link
- No guilt or pressure

#### Email 2: Value + Social Proof (Optional)

If they're high-value, send email too:

```
Subject: "Quick question"

[First Name],

We missed each other earlier today.

I understand things come up - no worries.

I had prepared some ideas for you based on [their challenge from form].

Similar to what we did for [Similar Client] who went from [A] to [B] in [timeframe].

Still interested in discussing?

Book here: [Link]

[Your Name]
```

**Key Elements:**
- Shows you prepared (reciprocity)
- Social proof (builds belief)
- Question format (engagement)
- Clear CTA

---

### Follow-Up #3: 24 Hours Later

Full day has passed. Time for urgency:

#### Email 3: The Direct Question

```
Subject: "Still interested?"

Hey [First Name],

I haven't heard from you since we missed our call yesterday.

Quick question: Are you still looking to solve [their problem]?

If YES → Book here: [Link]

If NO → Just reply and let me know. No hard feelings.

Either way, let me know so I can plan accordingly.

[Your Name]
[Phone]

P.S. - I had reviewed your info about [specific thing from their form]. I think I can help, but need to actually talk to you.
```

**Key Elements:**
- Direct question (forces decision)
- Binary choice (yes or no)
- Deadline implied ("let me know")
- P.S. shows personalization
- Respectful out (no hard feelings)

#### SMS 3: The Deadline

```
"[First Name] - this is my last attempt.

If you want help with [problem], book here: [Link]

If not, no worries. I'll assume you're all set.

- [Your Name]"
```

**Key Elements:**
- "Last attempt" (deadline)
- Still offering help (not angry)
- Assumption close (if no response, you're moving on)
- Respect (no guilt trip)

---

### Follow-Up #4: 3 Days Later (If No Response)

#### Email 4: The Breakup Email

```
Subject: "Closing your file"

[First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm going to assume you've either:
- Solved [problem] another way
- Decided it's not a priority right now
- Just got busy

All totally fine.

I'm closing your file so I can focus on people I can actively help.

If I'm wrong and you DO still want help, this is your last chance: [Link]

Otherwise, best of luck with [their business/goal].

[Your Name]

P.S. - If timing's just not right, keep me in mind for the future. You have my contact info.
```

**Key Elements:**
- "Closing your file" (finality)
- Give them plausible outs (saves face)
- "Last chance" (urgency)
- Respectful (best of luck)
- Leave door open for future (P.S.)

**Why This Works:**
- Scarcity (last chance)
- Takeaway (you're walking away)
- Often triggers response when nothing else does

#### SMS 4: Final Attempt (Optional)

Only if they're high-value:

```
"[First Name] - closing your file today unless I hear back.

Last chance: [Link]

- [Your Name]"
```

---

### Follow-Up #5: 7-14 Days Later (The Resurrection)

If they STILL haven't responded, wait 1-2 weeks, then try ONE more time with fresh angle:

#### Email 5: The Fresh Start

```
Subject: "New approach"

Hey [First Name],

I know I said I was closing your file, but I just thought of something that might help with [their problem].

[Specific insight, new angle, or case study]

Figured I'd share in case you're still dealing with this.

If you want to discuss, I have a few slots open this week: [Link]

If not, I'll leave you alone - promise.

[Your Name]
```

**Key Elements:**
- Lead with value (insight)
- Acknowledge previous attempts (self-aware)
- New angle (not same pitch)
- "I'll leave you alone" (this really IS last time)

---

## No-Show Recovery Sequence Variations

### For Last-Minute Cancellations (They Cancel <24hrs Before)

#### Immediate Response:

```
SMS:
"No problem [First Name] - when works better for you?

Here's my calendar: [Link]

- [Your Name]"
```

```
Email:
Subject: "No worries - let's reschedule"

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for letting me know you can't make [original time].

No problem - grab a new time that works better: [Link]

Looking forward to talking about [their problem].

[Your Name]
```

**Key Elements:**
- No guilt (they did the right thing by canceling)
- Immediate reschedule option
- Positive tone

#### Follow-Up (If They Don't Reschedule):

Use standard no-show sequence starting at Follow-Up #2 (24 hours later).

---

### For Multiple Reschedules (They Reschedule 2+ Times)

After 2nd reschedule:

#### Email: The Commitment Check

```
Subject: "Let's make sure this makes sense"

Hey [First Name],

I noticed you've had to reschedule a couple times - totally get it, life happens.

But before we book again, I want to make sure this is actually a priority for you.

If solving [their problem] is urgent, let's lock in a time that REALLY works: [Link]

But if now's not the right time, that's okay too. We can reconnect when it is.

Which is it?

[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Calls out the pattern (respectfully)
- Makes them commit or opt out
- Filters time-wasters
- Positions your time as valuable

---

### For Late Cancellations Via Email/Text (They Cancel Day-Of)

#### Immediate Response:

```
"Got it - is everything okay?

What day this week could you do instead?"
```

**Follow-Up If No Response:**

Use standard sequence starting at Follow-Up #2.

---

### For "Ghosts" (They Join Then Leave Immediately)

Sometimes they join the call but leave within 30 seconds without explanation:

#### Immediate:

```
SMS:
"Hey [First Name] - looks like you got disconnected?

I'm still here: [Link]

Or call me: [Phone]

- [Your Name]"
```

#### 15 Minutes Later:

```
Email:
Subject: "Tech issues?"

Hey [First Name],

I saw you joined but then dropped off right away.

Technical issue?

I'm here for another 10 minutes if you want to try again: [Link]

Or we can reschedule: [Reschedule Link]

[Your Name]
```

**Then:**

If no response, enter standard no-show sequence at Follow-Up #2.

## Advanced No-Show Recovery Tactics

### Tactic 1: The Value-First Voicemail

Instead of text/email, leave actual voicemail:

```
"Hey [First Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company].

We had a call scheduled for [time] today but I didn't see you jump on.

No worries if something came up.

I had looked at your situation with [their problem] and I actually have a quick idea that might help, even if we don't end up working together.

Give me a call back when you get a chance: [Your Phone]

Or rebook here: [Link spoken clearly]

Talk soon."
```

**Why It Works:**
- Personal (voice vs text)
- Value-first (offering idea)
- No pressure (even if we don't work together)
- Multiple ways to respond

### Tactic 2: The Loom Video

Record 1-2 minute personalized video:

```
"Hey [First Name], [Your Name] here.

We missed our call today - no worries, stuff comes up.

But I did some homework on [their business] and I wanted to share a quick thought about [their problem]...

[Share 30 seconds of actual value/insight]

If you want to discuss this further, grab a new time here: [Link]

If not, hope this helps anyway.

Cheers!"
```

**Why It Works:**
- Highly personal
- Shows effort (reciprocity)
- Delivers value (even without call)
- Differentiates you
- Hard to ignore

### Tactic 3: The Referral Pivot

If they won't reschedule:

```
Email:
Subject: "Quick favor"

Hey [First Name],

I understand you're not moving forward right now.

No problem.

Quick favor: Do you know anyone in [their industry] who IS actively looking to solve [problem]?

I have a few open slots this week and I'd rather help someone who needs it now.

Happy to give them the same attention I would have given you.

Just reply with their name/email if anyone comes to mind.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Turns dead lead into referral source
- Shows you're not desperate (detachment)
- Often makes THEM reconsider (social proof)

### Tactic 4: The Content Share

If they're not ready to reschedule, stay on radar:

```
Email:
Subject: "Saw this and thought of you"

Hey [First Name],

I know you weren't able to make our call and that's totally fine.

I just recorded a quick video about [their problem] and thought you might find it useful: [Link]

No strings attached - just thought it'd help.

If you ever want to discuss your specific situation, you know where to find me.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Gives value without asking for anything
- Keeps you top of mind
- Opens door for future conversation
- Shows you're helpful, not just sales-y

## Copy Tonality Framework

### Early Messages (Immediate - 24hrs):
- **Tone:** Understanding, helpful, no pressure
- **Assumption:** They forgot or got busy
- **Goal:** Make rescheduling easy

### Mid Messages (24hrs - 3 days):
- **Tone:** Direct, value-focused, slight urgency
- **Assumption:** They're reconsidering
- **Goal:** Remind them why they booked, create deadline

### Late Messages (3+ days):
- **Tone:** Final, takeaway, respectful
- **Assumption:** They're not serious
- **Goal:** Trigger FOMO or let them go gracefully

---

## No-Show Prevention (Before It Happens)

Best recovery is prevention:

**Pre-Call:**
- Multiple reminders (email + SMS)
- Pre-call assignment (increases commitment)
- Clear value proposition
- Urgency building
- See: maximize_show_rates.md

**Red Flags:**
- Booked >7 days out (higher no-show rate)
- No response to pre-call assignment
- Unsubscribed from emails
- Phone number invalid

**If You See Red Flags:**

Send extra touch point:

```
"Hey [First Name] - we're on [Date].

Quick check: Is this still a priority for you?

Just want to make sure I'm not wasting your time or mine.

Reply YES if you're showing up.
Reply NO if you want to cancel.

[Your Name]"
```

Filters them before the no-show.

## No-Show Response Scripts by Reason

### "Sorry, forgot"

```
You: "No worries! When's better for you?"

[Make it easy to reschedule]
```

### "Got busy"

```
You: "Totally understand. This is important though - when can we lock in 30 min that you can really commit to?"

[Emphasize commitment]
```

### "Not sure this is right fit"

```
You: "Fair enough. What specifically makes you think it's not a fit?

[Uncover real objection]

Often people think X but actually Y is the issue. Worth 15 min to explore?"

[Offer shorter call]
```

### "Already solved it"

```
You: "That's great! What did you end up doing?

[Genuine curiosity - might not be fully solved]

If it doesn't work out, keep me in mind."

[Leave door open]
```

### "Too expensive" (before even talking)

```
You: "I get it. But we haven't even talked about pricing yet.

The call is free. Worst case, you get free advice.

Best case, you solve [their problem].

Why not just take the call?"

[Reframe call as free value]
```

## What NOT to Do

❌ Guilt trip or shame them
❌ Get angry or passive-aggressive
❌ Give up after one follow-up
❌ Make them explain themselves
❌ Charge no-show fees (hurts reputation)
❌ Remove them from all sequences (leave door open)
❌ Call 10 times in a row (desperate)
❌ Send same message repeatedly (no creativity)

## What TO Do

✅ Stay professional and understanding
✅ Make rescheduling frictionless
✅ Provide value even without call
✅ Set clear deadlines
✅ Use multiple channels (email, SMS, phone)
✅ Vary your messages (different angles)
✅ Know when to walk away (respect yourself)
✅ Leave door open for future

---

## Success Metrics

A good no-show sequence should:
- Recover 30-50% of no-shows
- Get response from 60%+ within 72 hours
- Convert 10-20% of no-shows to eventual customers
- Filter out tire-kickers efficiently

If you're below these benchmarks, test:
- Message tonality
- Timing intervals
- Value propositions
- Urgency tactics
- Multiple media (video, voice, text)

---

## The Golden Rule

**A no-show is data, not rejection.**

They showed enough interest to book. Something broke down between booking and showing.

Your job: Figure out what, rebuild commitment, and give them a frictionless path to reschedule.

If they don't reschedule after a solid sequence, they weren't serious. Move on.
