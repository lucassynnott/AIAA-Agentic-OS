# SKILL BIBLE: Scaling to $500K/Month with Paid Ads (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents Daniel Fazio's comprehensive framework for scaling B2B businesses to $500K/month+ using paid advertising. The system generated $1.161M in one month with $183K ad spend (6.3x ROAS), booking 766 qualified calls and closing 2,800+ sales. The core principles: ruthless lead qualification, availability variance management, portfolio product strategy, and systematic creative testing.

**Key Insight:** Your only two jobs are increasing LTV and decreasing CAC. Everything else is noise. If an activity doesn't directly impact one of these, stop doing it.

---

## Section 1: The CAC/LTV Framework

### The Only Two Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Definition | Your Job |
|--------|------------|----------|
| CAC | Cost to acquire a customer | Decrease it |
| LTV | Lifetime value of a customer | Increase it |

**Every useful business activity falls into one of these categories:**
- Customer service? → Increases retention → LTV
- Better ads? → Lower cost per call → CAC
- New product? → More revenue per customer → LTV

### CAC to LTV Calculator

**Variables:**
```
Monthly Ad Spend: [X]
Cost Per Qualified Live Call: [Y]
Close Rate: [Z]

Calls = Ad Spend / Cost Per Call
Closes = Calls × Close Rate
CAC = Ad Spend / Closes
```

**Example:**
```
$30,000 ad spend
$420 cost per qualified live call
28% close rate

Calls: 71
Closes: 20
CAC: $1,500

If LTV is $35,000 → LTV:CAC = 23:1
```

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Formula:**
```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR) / Starting MRR
```

**What It Tells You:**
- NRR < 100% = Shrinking without new customers
- NRR = 100% = Stable without new customers
- NRR > 100% = Growing without new customers

**Example:**
- 100 clients at $1,000/mo = $100K MRR
- Lose 10 clients (-$10K)
- Upsell 10 clients from $1K to $2K (+$10K)
- NRR = 100% (stable)

---

## Section 2: The Portfolio of Products Strategy (Operation Hyperscale)

### Why Multiple Offers = Exponential Profit

**Single offer limitations:**
- LTV capped by that offer's retention
- Churned customers = lost forever
- Can only scale to that offer's market size

**Multiple offers unlock:**
- Churn from Offer 1 → Downsell to Offer 2
- Buyers of Offer 1 → Cross-sell to Offer 3
- All past customers → Launch Offer 4, instant revenue

### The Geometric Expansion Model

```
Offer 1 (Self-liquidating) ─┐
Offer 2 (Self-liquidating) ─┼→ Acquired Customer Pool
Offer 3 (Low-ticket)       ─┘
                               ↓
                    Launch Offer 4 (Upsell)
                               ↓
                    $2,000 pure profit per sale
                               ↓
                    Launch Offer 5 (Cross-sell)
                               ↓
                    $2,500 pure profit per sale
```

### What Each New Offer Does

Every additional offer simultaneously:
- Decreases net revenue churn
- Increases lifetime value
- Decreases CAC (more optionality)
- Increases reactivations
- Increases net revenue expansion
- Increases free cash flow

**Reality check:** "Apple has 60+ products. Procter & Gamble has 4,000+ SKUs. CocaCola owns 600+ brands. You have one offer and wonder why you're not rich."

### The Left Side / Right Side Model

**Left Side = Revenue Generation:**
- Self-liquidating offers
- Goal: Break even, acquire maximum buyers
- Profit = $0 (intentionally)

**Right Side = Profit Generation:**
- Upsells, cross-sells, renewals
- Goal: Maximize revenue from acquired customers
- Profit = 100% (no additional CAC)

---

## Section 3: Lead Qualification System

### The Core Problem

Unqualified leads destroy everything:
- Train pixel to find more unqualified people
- Waste sales team time
- Crash close rates
- Increase CAC
- Burn out closers

### The Typeform Qualification Flow

**Question 1: Market Fit**
```
"Are you a B2B company or B2C company?"
[We do not work with B2C companies who sell to consumers]
- I'm B2B → Continue
- I'm B2C → AUTO-REJECT
```

**Question 2: Revenue Threshold**
```
"What's your approximate current monthly revenue?"
- $0-$5,000 → AUTO-REJECT
- $5,000-$30,000 → Continue
- $30,000+ → Continue
```

**Question 3: Budget Confirmation**
```
"Are you able to spend $X to get started and $Y/month ongoing?"
[Reveal actual pricing]
- Yes → Continue
- No → AUTO-REJECT
```

**Question 4: Market Size (if relevant)**
```
"Do you estimate your total addressable market is more than 15,000 people?"
- Yes → Continue
- No → AUTO-REJECT
```

### The Math Proof

**Without Qualification:**
- $1,000/day spend
- $50/call
- 20 calls/day
- 80% unqualified
- 5% close rate
- 1 close per day
- Need 4 closers to manage 20 calls
- Zero profit

**With Qualification:**
- $1,000/day spend
- $250/call
- 4 calls/day
- 100% qualified
- 32% close rate
- 1.3 closes per day
- Need 1 closer
- High profit

### Optimization for Qualified Leads

**Optimize for call scheduled, NOT opt-ins:**
- Only people who complete typeform correctly get marked as conversions
- Pixel learns to find people like those who qualified
- Cost per qualified call decreases over time

## Section 4: The Funnel Architecture

### B2B High-Ticket Funnel Flow

```
Meta/Google Ads
      ↓
Opt-in Page (Name, Email, Phone)
      ↓
VSSL Page (Long-form video)
      ↓
"Book a Call" Button
      ↓
Typeform (Qualification questions)
      ↓
[If qualified] Calendar
      ↓
Sales Call
      ↓
Close
```

### Opt-in Page Rules

**Include:**
- Clean, singular headline
- Name, email, phone fields
- Button: "Get Pricing and Details"

**Exclude:**
- Videos
- Testimonials
- Excessive text

**Why:** The VSSL page handles persuasion. Opt-in is just data capture.

### When to Use Opt-ins

| Audience Revenue | Use Opt-in? |
|-----------------|-------------|
| <$100K/month | Yes |
| $100K-$200K/month | Test |
| >$200K/month | No (direct to VSSL) |

### Email + Setter Workflow

**If using opt-ins:**
1. Leads enter 5-10 day automated sequence (1-2 emails/day)
2. Also receive broadcast emails (1/day)
3. Total: 2-3 emails/day
4. Setters call immediately (double dial)
5. Setters text day-of + next 3 days
6. Sporadic calls for 1-2 weeks

**Setter Qualification Rule:**
Setters MUST do the same qualification as Typeform:
- Ask revenue
- Reveal price
- Confirm budget

If they don't do this → Don't pay commission → Prevents dog leads

---

## Section 5: Availability Variance

### The Calendar Capacity Problem

**What happens at 70%+ calendar capacity:**
- Available slots become less convenient for prospects
- Prospects either don't book (↑ cost per call) or book bad times (↑ no-shows)
- Cost per call inflates 50-70%
- ROI crashes

### The Shoe Store Analogy

"If you sell shoes but don't stock sizes 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, or 11.5—you're excluding most of your market. That's what you're doing with limited calendar availability."

### Availability Variance Rules

1. **Prime time slots:** 9-11am and 1-2pm (highest demand)
2. **30-minute increments:** Throughout the day
3. **Multiple closers:** Each has full availability
4. **70% threshold:** Hire new closer when any calendar hits 70%

### Scaling Formula

```
Daily Ad Spend = (Cost per call × Calls per closer × Number of closers)

Example:
$300 cost per call × 5 calls × 5 closers = $7,500/day max
```

**To scale past this:** Hire another closer FIRST, then increase ad spend.

## Section 6: Media Buying Strategy

### Creative Testing Framework

**Hook/Body Testing:**
- Ad Set A: Hook 1 + Body 1, Hook 2 + Body 1, Hook 3 + Body 1 (testing hooks)
- Ad Set B: Hook 1 + Body 1, Hook 1 + Body 2, Hook 1 + Body 3 (testing bodies)

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

**Wrong:** Scale single ad set from $300 → $3,000

**Right:** Run 10 ad sets at $300 each = $3,000 total

### Audience Targeting

**Rule:** 100% broad targeting, no interests, no lookalikes

**Why AI targeting wins:**
- AI transcribes your video
- AI reads your copy
- AI matches to users interested in those topics
- You cannot beat the algorithm manually

**What you say = who you target:**
- Say "agency owners" → targets agency owners
- Say "B2B companies" → targets B2B
- Say "coaches" → targets coaches

### Landing Page as Targeting

Your landing page copy also trains the algorithm:
- "This is only for B2B companies above $30K/month"
- Only qualified people opt-in
- Pixel optimizes for those people

### Budget Management

| Daily Spend | New Creatives/Week |
|------------|-------------------|
| $500 | 5 every 2 weeks |
| $3,000 | 5/week |
| $6,000 | 10/week minimum |

**Rules:**
- Start new ad sets at $200/day minimum
- Increase 10-20% every few days if performing
- Turn off if cost per call exceeds 2x target after 3 days

### Video vs Static

**For B2B:** Video ads outperform static 99% of the time. If you're only using statics, that's why your ads don't work.

## Section 7: VSSL Requirements

### Why You Need a VSSL

"If you think you're going to sell high-ticket to cold traffic without a long-form video sales letter, you are completely deluded. There's a 0% probability this works without it."

### VSSL Components

1. **Clear offer explanation**
2. **Results/case studies**
3. **Process walkthrough**
4. **Pricing revealed**
5. **Qualification criteria stated**
6. **Call to action**

### Price Revelation Strategy

**For B2B, reveal pricing:**
- Saves sales team time
- Increases close rates
- Trains pixel correctly
- Reduces sales team churn

## Section 8: Common Scaling Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Low Cost Per Call Bragging

"$80 calls bro!" → 100% poor people with no money

**Reality:** High-quality leads cost $250-$400. That's the game.

### Mistake 2: Scaling Against Fixed Calendar

Increasing ad spend without hiring closers = scaling e-commerce without inventory.

### Mistake 3: Not Using Opt-ins Properly

If you collect email/phone → use them aggressively:
- 2-3 emails/day
- Immediate double-dial
- Ongoing text sequences

If not doing this → don't use opt-ins at all.

### Mistake 4: Trying to Profit on Frontend

Profit comes from back-end (upsells, cross-sells, renewals).
Frontend should break even to acquire maximum buyers.

### Mistake 5: Single Offer Business

One offer = capped LTV, no churn recovery, limited scale.
