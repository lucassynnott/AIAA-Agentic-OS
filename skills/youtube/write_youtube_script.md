# Skill: Write YouTube Script

## Goal
Create high-retention, value-packed YouTube scripts that educate and convert, using proven frameworks for hooks, retention, and calls to action.

## When to Use
- When planning a new YouTube video (long-form).
- After the basic topic is selected but before filming.
- To restructure existing content into a video format.

## Prerequisites
- **Market Research Data**: You must have validated "Common Myths" and "Pain Points" from the Market Research agent.
- **Competitor Analysis**: You must know what the "Old Way" is to position against it.

## Key Principles (The "Anti-Fragile" Approach)
1.  **Packaging First**: Never write a script without defining the Title and Thumbnail concept first. They create the *expectation* the script must satisfy.
2.  **Reality > Expectations**: The script's job is to deliver *more* value than the click promised.
3.  **Speed to Value**: Deliver the first value point immediately after the intro. No fluff.
4.  **Atomic Messaging**: Use 6th-grade language. Simple words, short sentences.
5.  **Guide, Not Guru**: "Here is how I did it," not "Here is what you must do."
6.  **No "Goodbye"**: Never signal the end of the video. Transition directly to the next video recommendation.

7.  **Length Requirement**: 6-12 minutes = 1,200 - 2,400 words. (Approx 200 words/min).
    *   *Note*: To achieve this, you must "Deep Dive" into examples. Do not just list steps. Walk through the *nuance* of each step.

## The Execution Formula

### Step 1: The Holy Trifecta (Packaging)
*Before writing a single line of script, define:*
1.  **Topic**: The core pain point or desire.
2.  **Title**: The headline that grabs attention (Click Curiosity).
3.  **Thumbnail Concept**: The visual that complements the title.

### Step 2: The Outline (Anti-Fragile Structure)
*Create a bulleted list of value points. Do not script word-for-word yet.*
*   **Rule of Order**: Put your **2nd best point FIRST**. Put your **BEST point SECOND**.
    *   *Why?* If point 2 is better than point 1, it creates a subconscious pattern that value is increasing, keeping them watching.
*   **Modular Design**: Each point should be self-contained so you can swap/remove them without breaking the flow.

### Step 3: The Hook (0:00 - 0:45)
*The most critical part. Use this 5-part framework:*
1.  **Immediate Context**: "Today we are talking about [Topic]..." (Confirm the click).
2.  **Common Belief**: "Most people think [X]..." (Establish common ground).
3.  **Contrarian Take**: "But actually, the truth is [Y]..." (Create a gap/curiosity).
4.  **Proof/Credibility**: "I've generated [X] results / analyzed [Y] cases..." (Why listen to me?).
5.  **The Plan**: "In this video, I'm breaking down the 5 steps to..." (Set expectations).

### Step 4: The Body (The Value Loop)
*For each point in your outline, use this structure. To hit the 8-12 minute mark, you must SPEND TIME here.*
1.  **Context**: What is it? (Simple definition).
2.  **Application (The Meat)**: How do you use it?
    *   *Step-by-Step*: Break it down into 3 sub-steps.
    *   *Example*: Give a concrete, real-world example or story.
    *   *Nuance*: "Most people fail here because..." (Add depth).
    *   *Tactical Insight*: "Click this button," "Say this specific phrase."
3.  **Framing**: Why does it matter? (Zoom out to the big picture).

*   **Length Check**: Each Body Point should be roughly 300-500 words. If it's shorter, you are staying too surface level. Go deeper.

*   **Retention Hack - The Re-Hook**: Every 2-3 minutes (between points), remind them why the *next* point is crucial.
    *   *Example*: "Now that you have [Point 1], it's useless unless you combine it with [Point 2]..."

### Step 5: Calls to Action (CTA) & Outro
*   **Native Embeds**: Don't break flow for ads/CTAs. Weave them into the solution.
    *   *Example*: "The verified solution for [Pain Point] is actually [Your Product/Lead Magnet] (brief mention) so check that out if you want to go deeper, but let's look at step 3..."
*   **The End Screen (The "No-Goodbye" Rule)**:
    *   Do **NOT** say: "Thanks for watching," "In conclusion," "Hope you liked it."
    *   **DO** say: "Now that you've mastered [Topic A], you need to fix [Topic B] which I cover in this video right here..." (Point to screen).

## AI Script Generation Prompt (CGP Framework)
*Use this prompt structure with Claude or your preferred LLM.*

**Context:**
"I am a YouTube scriptwriter for [Niche/Audience]. My style is [Tone: e.g., casual, authoritative, fast-paced]. I am writing a script for a video titled '[Title]'."

**Goal:**
"My goal is to [Goal: e.g., educate beginners on X]. I need high retention. The script should use 6th-grade vocabulary, short sentences, and specific examples. **IMPORTANT:** The script MUST be between 1,200 and 2,000 words to ensure a 6-12 minute runtime. Do NOT summarize."

**Prompt:**
"Write a YouTube script using the following structure:
1.  **Hook**: Use the Context -> Common Belief -> Contrarian Take -> Credibility -> Plan framework.
2.  **Body**: Cover these points: [List Points]. Put the 2nd best point first.
    *   **CRITICAL**: For *each* point, write 300-500 words. Use the 'Context -> Application (Steps + Story + Nuance) -> Framing' loop. Go deep. Give specific examples.
3.  **Outro**: Transition directly to a suggested video about [Next Topic] without a formal goodbye.
4.  **Tone**: Conversational, 'Guide not Guru'. Use 6th-grade reading level.
5.  **Length**: Total script must be at least 1500 words."

## Quality Checklist
| Component | Check |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Length** | Is it >1,200 words? (If not, expand the "Application" sections with examples) |
| **Reading Level** | Is it ~6th grade? (Use Hemingway App or similar to check) |
| **Hook** | Does it confirm the title immediately? Does it offer a unique insight? |
| **Body Flow** | Is the 2nd best point first? are there "Re-hooks" between sections? |
| **No Fluff** | Did you delete "Hey guys welcome back"? Did you cut "In conclusion"? |
| **CTA** | Is the CTA "native" (woven in)? Is the final transition abrupt and directive? |
| **Credential** | Did you establish *why* you are qualified early on? |
