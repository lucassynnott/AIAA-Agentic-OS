> Context: How to scale a digital product funnel to generate free agency leads - $1M+ case study

## Executive Summary

The digital product funnel is the best risk-free way to scale agency client acquisition. By selling a low-ticket digital product ($97), you break even on ad spend immediately while building a list of paying customers who become high-ticket clients. Larsen sold 14,500 units and generated $1M+ in agency revenue from the 2.1% that upgraded.

## Why Digital Product Funnels Work

### The Feedback Loop Advantage

**Traditional lead funnels:**
- 30-60-90 day sales cycle
- Spending money hoping it comes back
- Long wait for feedback

**Digital product funnels:**
- Instant feedback (buy or don't buy)
- Cash flow same day
- Can iterate quickly

### The Break-Even Promise Land

> "Breaking even in terms of ad spend on this type of funnel is kind of like the Promise Land."

**The Math:**
```
AOV: $100
CPA: $80
Result: Getting leads for FREE
```

**Why it works:**
- Ad cost liquidated on front end
- No stress upselling
- Don't need them to become clients to survive
- Pure profit on any upgrades

### Paying Customers vs. Free Optins

> "These are paying customers - they're not free optins. They've signified they have a credit card and are willing to spend."

**Free optins:**
- Anyone with an email
- No commitment
- Low quality

**Paying customers:**
- Proved they have money
- Have the problem
- Willing to spend
- Much more likely to convert

## The 8 Criteria for Digital Products

### 1. Makes Money or Saves Time

The product must clearly do one or both:
- Make them more money
- Save them significant time

### 2. Priced Under $100

> "$97 seems to be the impulse purchase psychological limit."

**Why $97 specifically:**
- Highest price before $100 threshold
- More margin for ad costs
- Higher buyers = less refunds
- Higher buyers = more likely to upgrade

### 3. Clear 100x ROI Path

Customer must be able to see how they could get 100x return.

**Example:**
- $97 templates
- Makes ads 10% better
- They spend $100K/month on ads
- = $10,000/month improvement
- = 100x ROI in first month

### 4. 100% Automated (No Fulfillment)

> "A lot of people say 'I'll make you three ad creatives for $97.' That's not a digital product - that is a service that costs $97."

**Product:** Templates, assets, swipe files, courses
**Service:** Anything requiring your involvement

**If you play ANY part = not a product = can't scale**

### 5. Four Bonuses Worth the Price

Each bonus should be worth the full price of the main product.

**Example (Larsen's $97 templates):**
- Bonus 1: Copywriting prompts ($97 value)
- Bonus 2: 25 A/B tests to run ($97 value)
- Bonus 3: Offer creation masterclass ($97 value)
- Bonus 4: Swipe file of successful pages ($97 value)

**The Psychology:**
> "If even ONE of the five things is worth it, this is worth buying."

### 6. Quick to Use, Low Learning Curve

- Not complex to implement
- Minimal software requirements
- Fast time to value

### 7. Natural Continuation to Main Service

**The whole point is upselling to agency services.**

| Digital Product | Natural Upsell |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Landing page templates | Done-for-you landing pages |
| Ad creative templates | Done-for-you ad management |
| Email templates | Done-for-you email marketing |
| SEO audit tools | Done-for-you SEO |

### 8. Attractive to ALL Levels

> "Should be just as attractive to beginners as 9-10 figure CEOs."

**Beginners:** Need the templates, will use themselves
**Big brands:** "$97? Send it to my team, see if they want it"

**If it only appeals to one level, you're limiting scale.**

## Landing Page Design

### Focus: Copy Over Design

> "Should not be like an e-commerce page focused on design. Should be very copy focused and focused on results."

**Required Elements:**
- Video or photo examples of what they get
- Heavy copy (not just pretty images)
- Social proof throughout
- Results they'll achieve

### Structure

1. Headline (result they get)
2. Sub-headline (how)
3. Video/preview of product
4. Features with benefits
5. Social proof
6. Bonuses breakdown
7. FAQ
8. Final CTA

## The Math That Matters

### The Core Formula

```
Conversion Rate Target: 3%
AOV: $97
Required CPC: $2.90 or less

Check: $2.90 CPC × 33.3 clicks = $96.57 to acquire
        $97 sale = slight profit (before processing)
```

### Why Book-a-Call Math Doesn't Apply

**Book-a-call funnel:**
- $30 CPC acceptable
- 10% call book rate = $300/call
- 20% close rate = $1,500 CPA
- $20K LTV = works

**Digital product funnel:**
- $30 CPC = impossible to profit
- Must be under $3 CPC to work

> "Know what type of funnel you're doing and don't try to apply math that doesn't work."

## Pricing Strategy

### Why $97 Specifically

| Price | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| $17-27 | Higher conversion | Hard to get CPA that low, more refunds |
| $47 | Medium ground | Still tight on CPA |
| $97 | Best margin for ads, fewer refunds, better buyers | Slightly lower conversion |
| $197+ | Past impulse threshold | Much lower conversion |

> "The more they pay on the front end, the less likely they are to refund and the more likely they are to convert to a client."

---

## Passive + Active Distribution

### Passive Channels

- YouTube description
- Twitter bio
- LinkedIn featured
- Email signature
- Website footer
- Community pinned posts

### Active Channel (Main Driver)

**Paid ads** - this is where scale comes from

**Why ads work here:**
- Instant cash flow back
- Can scale immediately
- Don't need to wait for organic growth
