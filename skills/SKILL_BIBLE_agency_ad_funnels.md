## Executive Summary

Paid ads are the most scalable form of traffic but also the highest risk. This skill bible covers the six types of ad funnels agencies can use, when to use each, and the testing framework to continuously improve performance.

## The Infinite Cycle of Lead Generation

### Positive Side (More Leads)
```
More leads → Less needy → Easier to sell → Can say no to nightmare clients → More clients → More referrals → Higher prices → More margin → Better hires → Less time working → More time/money to reinvest → Even more leads
```

### Negative Side (Less Leads)
```
Less leads → More needy → Harder to sell → Take nightmare clients → Less clients → Less referrals → Lower prices → Lower margin → Worse hires → More time working → Less to reinvest → Even less leads
```

## Five Prerequisites Before Running Paid Ads

### 1. Already Doing Outreach and Content

**Why:** If someone clicks your ad and profile is bare/uninspiring = not trustworthy

> "The conversion rate and click-through rate of ads is directly proportionate to having an active social media profile."

### 2. Losing $3K/Month Doesn't Matter

**Minimum:** $100/day = $3K/month
**Reason:** Less than that = data too slow to optimize

**Rule:** Only run ads if you're at $30K+/month revenue

### 3. Have an Appointment Setter

**Must contact leads within 5 minutes**
**Impact:** 2-5x more calls with proper appointment setting vs. without

### 4. Target Market is 10,000+ Businesses

**If smaller (e.g., Fortune 500):** Use outreach, networking, events instead
**Reason:** Not enough volume for ads to optimize

### 5. Offer is Proven to Convert

**Test with:** Outreach and content first
**Why:** Same feedback without risking money

> "If you've only ever gotten clients from referrals, you probably don't even have an offer."

## The Six Ad Funnel Types

### Funnel 1: Direct Offer Funnel

**Best For:** Strong intro offer that's inherently obvious to target market

**Structure:**
```
Ad → VSSL Page → Application Form → [Qualified] → Book Call → Thank You → Sales Call
                                   → [Unqualified] → Downsell Page
```

**DON'T Use When:**
- No obvious intro offer for your service
- Service isn't inherently valuable (e.g., generic Google Ads agency)

---

### Funnel 2: Training Funnel

**Best For:** When prospects need to try your ideas to believe you

**Example:** Sales trainer gives tips → Prospect tries them → They work → Prospect converts

**Structure:** Same as Direct Offer, but VSSL focuses on training/tips

**DON'T Use When:**
- Service is commoditized (email marketing, SEO)
- No perceived value in training (been around too long)

---

### Funnel 3: Case Study Funnel

**Best For:** Targeting bigger businesses (8-9 figure companies)

**Why:** 
- Bureaucracy too strong for direct offers
- They're already successful, don't need training
- Want to see results from similar companies

**Key:** Case study must be impressive TO YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE

**Example:**
- Bad: "Added $200K revenue" (not impressive to 8-figure business)
- Good: "Added $6M/month over 12 months" (impressive to target)

**DON'T Use When:**
- No impressive case study for your specific target market

---

### Funnel 4: Webinar Funnel

**Best For:**
1. Need to artificially condense sales cycle
2. Need to explain something complex
3. Both

**Example:** YouTube-based business where normal sales cycle is 3-6 months
**Solution:** Jam-pack 3-6 months of content into 60-90 minute webinar

**Structure:**
```
Ad → Webinar Signup Page → Conduct Webinar → [Self-Qualify] → Book Call → Sales Call
                                            → [Self-DQ] → Downsell
```

**DON'T Use When:**
- Ultra high-ticket or enterprise clients
- Time is too valuable for 60-180 minute webinar

---

### Funnel 5: Lead Magnet Funnel

**Best For:** Already scaling with other funnels working

**Purpose:** Pour extra fuel on the fire, build list, buy more impressions

**Structure:**
```
Ad → Lead Magnet Opt-in → Thank You Page (promotes conversion mechanism)
                                ↓
                        Community/Webinar/VSSL
                                ↓
                        Newsletter (daily) + Appointment Setter
                                ↓
                        Cross-promote other mechanisms
                                ↓
                        [Qualified] → Book Call
                        [Unqualified] → Downsell
```

**DON'T Use When:**
- Don't have every other part of funnel working
- This is NOT for starting fires, only adding fuel

---

### Funnel 6: Digital Product Funnel

**Best For:**
- Have templates/assets that obviously save time or make money
- Beginners (lower risk - break even on ad spend)

**Examples:**
- Email marketing agency → Email templates
- Ad agency → Ad templates
- Landing page agency → Landing page templates

**Structure:**
```
Ad → Sales Page → Checkout → One-Time Upsell → Onboarding
                                                    ↓
                                            Training + Access + Swipe Files
                                            Post-Purchase Flow (7-14 days)
                                            Community
                                                    ↓
                                            Upsell Flow → Done-For-You Service
```

**Key Metric:** 
- Price: $97
- Target: Break even on ad spend (Self-Liquidating Offer)
- If selling $20 product = hard to get $20 CAC
- If selling $97 product = much easier to break even

**DON'T Use When:**
- Can't offer templates/frameworks/assets
- Only have info (info alone doesn't work as digital product)

## The Four Ad Funnel Categories

### Category 1: VSSL/Webinar Funnel

**Best When:** Have specific training, case study, or presentation that convinces people to buy

**Goal:** Get them to book a call (webinar/VSSL pushes them over finish line)

**Reality Check:**
> "Don't assume you're going to get more than 20% of booked calls to close."

This accounts for:
- No-shows
- Unqualified leads
- Cold traffic (won't convert like referrals)

### Category 2: Newsletter Funnel

**Best When:**
1. High-price service with longer sales cycle, OR
2. "Emergency" service (they remember you when needed)

**Structure:**
```
Ad → Landing Page (with lead magnet) → Thank You → Newsletter (3-5x/week)
                                                         ↓
                                                   Enrich data (Apollo)
                                                   Appointment setter outreach
                                                   Cross-promote (webinar, VSSL, content)
```

**Critical Step:** 
- Take entire newsletter list
- Put in Apollo or similar
- Enrich data (get company emails)
- Have appointment setter reach out to qualified subscribers

**ONLY Works If:** You have entire marketing funnel working

> "People don't just sign up for your newsletter and convert on the thank you page."

### Category 3: Group Funnel

**Best When:** They need tips or to see results before trusting you enough to buy

**Structure:**
```
Ad → Email + Phone Capture → Thank You (promotes group) → Join Group
                                                              ↓
                                                   SMS Flow (inviting to group)
                                                   Email Flow (inviting to group)
                                                              ↓
                                                   Inside Group:
                                                   - Content
                                                   - Appointment setters
                                                   - Retargeting ads
                                                   - Email flows
                                                              ↓
                                                   Sync to CRM
```

**The Catch:**
> "Best one IF you put tremendous effort into it. If not, it's the WORST."

**Requires:**
- Hours per day in the group
- Messaging people inside group
- Constant posting
- Email flows
- Appointment setter activity

### Category 4: Paid Product Funnel

**Best For Beginners:**
> "The problem with other three is you're spending money hoping it works. With paid product, you break even."

**Math:**
- Sell $97 product
- Get purchase for $90 ad spend
- = Break even, no risk

**Then:**
- Make them aware of main offer
- Use appointment setter
- Content/ads: "I saw you bought my templates, watch this VSSL about..."
- Upsell to done-for-you service

---

## Ad Testing Framework

### The Structure

**Campaign:** 1 campaign for testing
**Ad Sets:** 1 ad set per body (2 ad sets)
**Ads:** 10 hooks per ad set (20 ads total)

### Why This Works

1. **Hooks are most important** - First 1-5 seconds determine if they watch
2. **10 hooks = never know what works** - Test many variations
3. **2 bodies = test proof placement** - Version A vs Version B

### The Two Body Versions

**Version A:** What → Why → How → Proof (at end)
**Version B:** Proof (at beginning) → What → Why → How

### Hook Requirements (First 3-5 Seconds)

1. Call out target audience
2. Visual hook (not just verbal)
3. Show your face
4. Convey the result they'll get

### 10 Example Hooks

1. "Want to double your [desired outcome] on [platform]? This is how you do it."
2. "Want to get twice as many clients for your agency? This is how."
3. "This is why your [product/problem] isn't working."
4. "Agency owners, you won't believe this."
5. "How I grew my agency to $900K/month within 12 months."
6. "If you are an agency owner, listen up."
7. "The number one thing I tell every agency owner is this..."
8. "If you want to work with [niche], you need to hear this."
9. "When it comes to growing your agency, I only trust one single hack."
10. "If you run an agency, you're going to enjoy this video."

### How to Film Efficiently

1. Film body with teleprompter (2-3 minutes)
2. Film hooks separately (3-5 seconds each)
3. Edit hooks onto front of each body
4. Result: 20 unique ads from 2 body recordings + 10 hook recordings

### Measuring Results

**Compare Bodies (Ad Sets):**
- All hooks are same across ad sets
- Different results = body is the variable
- Compare: Ad Set 1 ($100/call) vs Ad Set 2 ($500/call)

**Compare Hooks (Ads within Ad Set):**
- All bodies are same within ad set
- Different results = hook is the variable
- Keep winners, cut losers

### The Result

Continuous improvement system that:
- Tests 2 body approaches simultaneously
- Tests 10 hook variations per body
- Identifies winning combinations
- Ensures ads improve over time
