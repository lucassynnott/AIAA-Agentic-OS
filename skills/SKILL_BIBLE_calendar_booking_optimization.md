## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A booked call means nothing if they don't show. Calendar optimization is about reducing friction to book AND maximizing show rates.

**Show Rate Targets**:
- Poor: <60%
- Average: 60-70%
- Good: 70-80%
- Excellent: 80%+

**The Show Rate Equation**:
```
Show Rate = (Perceived Value × Commitment × Reminders) / Time Gap
```
