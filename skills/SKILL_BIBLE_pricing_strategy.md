# SKILL BIBLE: Pricing Strategy for Maximum Profit (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents Daniel Fazio's counterintuitive pricing framework: sometimes you ARE charging too much. The goal isn't maximum price—it's maximum profit. If reducing price 50% increases sales velocity 300%, you should lower the price. The key insight: agencies are fixed-expense businesses where profit margin amplifies exponentially with volume.

**Key Quote:** "Despite what some people might tell you, sometimes you are in fact charging way too much money. There's a certain price where you reach the maximum amount of profit—that's what we're trying to get at here."

> This skill bible explains when to LOWER prices. The companion document explains when to RAISE prices.
> **Decision Framework:**
> - **Lower prices when:** Close rate <20%, sales feel like constant uphill battle, clients NOT telling you to charge more
> - **Raise prices when:** Close rate >30% consistently, you have perceived authority (content/recommendations), you can transfer logistical intensity (do more than competitors)

## Section 1: The Fixed Expense Reality

### Why Agencies Are Different

In a marketing agency, ~70% of expenses are FIXED:
- Software subscriptions
- Team salaries
- Office/tools
- Monthly commitments

**What this means:** You pay the same whether you have 2 clients or 20 clients.

### The Amplification Effect

```
Revenue: $30,000
Fixed Expenses: $20,000
Variable Expenses: 20% of revenue = $6,000
Total Expenses: $26,000
PROFIT: $4,000 (13.3% margin)

Revenue: $40,000 (just +33%)
Fixed Expenses: $20,000 (same)
Variable Expenses: $8,000
Total Expenses: $28,000
PROFIT: $12,000 (30% margin) ← Margin MORE than doubled!
```

### The Scaling Math

| Revenue | Fixed | Variable (20%) | Total Expense | Profit | Margin |
|---------|-------|----------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| $30K | $20K | $6K | $26K | $4K | 13% |
| $40K | $20K | $8K | $28K | $12K | 30% |
| $60K | $20K | $12K | $32K | $28K | 47% |
| $100K | $20K | $20K | $40K | $60K | 60% |
| $200K | $20K | $40K | $60K | $140K | 70% |

**The insight:** Each additional customer is MORE profitable than the last. Volume = exponential profit growth.

## Section 2: The Market Reality (2024+)

### What Changed

**2020-2021:**
- 0% interest rates
- Stimulus checks
- Money supply tripled
- Everyone said "raise your prices"
- Worked because: more money in market

**2023-2024+:**
- Higher interest rates
- No stimulus
- Money supply decreasing
- Clients' housing costs 3x
- Food costs 2x
- Brands making fewer sales
- Businesses can't expand (debt too expensive)

**Result:** If you raised prices during the money-printing era, you're now making no profit because sales velocity collapsed.

---

## Section 3: Finding Optimal Price

### The 20-30% Close Rate Test

**Target:** Close exactly 20-30% of your sales calls consistently.

| Close Rate | Diagnosis |
|------------|-----------|
| <15% | Catastrophic—major problems |
| 15-20% | Below optimal, may be overpriced |
| 20-30% | Optimal range |
| >30% | Potentially underpriced |

### The "Feel" Test

Closing deals should NOT feel like:
- Climbing Mount Everest
- A constant uphill battle
- "This person needs to see this, this person needs to see that"
- Total colossal pain in the ass

If it feels that hard → You're charging too much.

### The Unsolicited Feedback Test

**Critical indicator:** Are clients actively, unprompted telling you that you should charge more?

- If YES → Priced correctly or could raise
- If NO → You're charging too much

## Section 4: The Value Equation

### Hermosiôs Formula Applied

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

### Variable Breakdown

| Variable | What Influences It |
|----------|-------------------|
| Dream Outcome | The claim you make (how much money they'll make) |
| Perceived Likelihood | Guarantee + Case studies |
| Time Delay | How long you say it takes + Case study timelines |
| Effort & Sacrifice | YOUR PRICE |

### The Case Study Double-Whammy

Case studies simultaneously:
1. Increase perceived likelihood (proof it works)
2. Decrease time delay (proof of speed)

**Result:** Massive value amplification from single asset.

### Pricing as Value Lever

**If you lower price 20%:**
- Effort & Sacrifice decreases
- Overall value increases
- More people purchase
- Net profit can INCREASE despite lower price per unit

## Section 5: The Trade-Off Analysis

### When Higher Prices Hurt More Than Help

**Scenario A (High Price):**
- Close rate: 10%
- Sales cycle: 8 weeks
- Effort per sale: Very high
- Stress: Extreme

**Scenario B (20% Lower Price):**
- Close rate: 30%
- Sales cycle: 2 weeks
- Effort per sale: Low
- Stress: Manageable

**Reality:** 3x more revenue in 1/4 the time with 1/3 the effort.

### The Burnout Factor

When prices are too high:
- Every deal is a battle
- Stress accumulates
- Erratic decisions follow
- You start hating the business
- Business dies

**Conclusion:** Sometimes lower prices = better life AND more profit.

## Section 6: Margin Benchmarks

### By Revenue Level

| Monthly Revenue | Target Margin |
|-----------------|---------------|
| <$50K/month | 60-75% |
| $50K-$100K/month | 50-60% |
| $100K-$300K/month | 45-55% |
| $300K-$500K/month | 40-60% |
| >$500K/month | 40%+ |

### If Your Margin Is Too High

**If margin >75% at <$50K/month:**
- You need to be more aggressive
- Either spend more on marketing
- Or reduce prices to increase velocity

**Why:** High margins at low revenue = not enough volume = not growing = will eventually plateau or die.

## Section 7: The Sales Skill Objection

### The Common Pushback

"Why don't you just get better at sales instead of lowering price?"

### The Reality

**No amount of sales skill can:**
- Put money in someone's wallet that isn't there
- Overcome genuine inability to afford
- Change their actual financial situation

**When prospects say "I can't afford it":**
- Sometimes it's an objection to overcome
- Sometimes they literally cannot afford it
- Sales tricks don't animate additional dollars into their wallet

## Section 8: Diagnostic Framework

### Is It Really a Pricing Problem?

**Before adjusting price, confirm:**

| Symptom | Likely Problem |
|---------|----------------|
| No calls booking | Traffic/offer problem, NOT price |
| Calls book but don't close | Possibly price OR sales process |
| Close but high refund rate | Wrong fit OR fulfillment issue |
| Closing 5-15% | Likely overpriced |
| Closing 20-30% | Price is optimal |
| Closing 40%+ | Possibly underpriced |

### The Decision Tree

```
Are you getting enough calls?
├── NO → Traffic/offer problem (fix that first)
└── YES → Are you closing 20-30%?
    ├── NO (below 20%) → Consider lowering price
    ├── YES (20-30%) → Price is optimal
    └── NO (above 30%) → Consider raising price
```

## Section 9: Implementation Process

### Step 1: Gather Current Data
- [ ] Count calls booked last 30 days
- [ ] Count closes last 30 days
- [ ] Calculate close rate
- [ ] Calculate average deal size
- [ ] Map fixed vs variable expenses

### Step 2: Model Scenarios
- [ ] Create spreadsheet with current numbers
- [ ] Model 10% price reduction + estimated velocity increase
- [ ] Model 20% price reduction + estimated velocity increase
- [ ] Model 10% price increase + estimated velocity decrease
- [ ] Calculate profit for each scenario

### Step 3: Test
- [ ] Pick one price point to test
- [ ] Run for 2-4 weeks minimum
- [ ] Track close rate changes
- [ ] Track actual profit changes
- [ ] Adjust based on data

### Step 4: Iterate
- [ ] Continue testing until finding 20-30% close rate
- [ ] Verify margin is healthy for your revenue level
- [ ] Monitor client feedback about pricing

**Key Quote:** "If charging 20% higher prices means it takes 3x more work and extends your sales cycle 4x longer while most of your expenses are fixed, your entire business starts to become completely inefficient. It's better to just reduce the price 20% and have it be one-third the amount of work and realize the revenue four times faster."
