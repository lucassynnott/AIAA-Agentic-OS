## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Positioning is how prospects perceive you relative to alternatives. Niching is focusing on a specific market segment. Together, they determine whether you're a commodity or a premium solution.

**The Positioning Truth**: The riches are in the niches. Specialists command higher prices and close more deals than generalists.

**The Positioning Equation**:
```
Premium Pricing = (Specialization × Results × Reputation) / Competition
```

---

## 2. WHY NICHING MATTERS

### The Generalist Problem

**"We help businesses grow"** = You're competing with everyone

- Harder to stand out
- Price competition
- Harder to get referrals
- Harder to create content
- Harder to build expertise

### The Specialist Advantage

**"We help SaaS companies reduce churn by 40%"** = Clear, compelling

- Stand out immediately
- Premium pricing justified
- Easy referrals ("I know someone who does exactly that")
- Content writes itself
- Deep expertise develops

### The Math

**Generalist**: 1% of massive market = lots of competition
**Specialist**: 30% of small market = you own it
