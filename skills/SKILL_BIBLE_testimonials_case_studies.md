I can make it super easy—I'll send over a few questions, or we could do a quick 2-minute video call where I record your answers."
```

**Email**:
```
Subject: Quick favor? (2 min)

Hey [Name],

So excited about [recent result]—really proud of what we've accomplished together.

Would you be open to sharing a quick testimonial? Nothing fancy—just a few sentences about your experience.

I've attached a few questions to make it easy. Or if you prefer, we could do a quick video call (literally 5 min).

Either way works—whatever's easiest for you!
```
