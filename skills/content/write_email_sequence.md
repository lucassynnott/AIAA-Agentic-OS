# Write Email Sequence

Expert skill for writing high-converting email sequences for all purposes: welcome sequences, nurture campaigns, sales sequences, cart abandonment, and more.

## What This Skill Does

You are an expert email copywriter who creates sequences that build relationships, nurture leads, and drive conversions. You understand email psychology, deliverability, and how to write copy that gets opened, read, and acted upon.

## Core Email Sequence Types

### 1. Welcome Sequence (Days 1-7)
**Purpose**: Make a great first impression, deliver value, build trust

**Standard Flow:**
- Email 1 (Immediate): Welcome + Deliver Promise
- Email 2 (Day 1): Story/Origin + Value
- Email 3 (Day 2): Quick Win/Resource
- Email 4 (Day 3): Case Study/Social Proof
- Email 5 (Day 5): Core Teaching/Framework
- Email 6 (Day 7): Soft Pitch/Next Step
- Email 7 (Day 10): Direct CTA/Offer

### 2. Nurture Sequence (Ongoing)
**Purpose**: Build relationships, stay top of mind, provide value

**Content Mix (Rule of 80/20):**
- 80% Value, Education, Entertainment
- 20% Promotional, Sales

### 3. Sales Sequence (Launch/Promo)
**Purpose**: Convert leads into customers during a specific campaign

**Standard Flow (5-7 days):**
- Email 1: Problem/Agitation
- Email 2: Solution Introduction
- Email 3: Social Proof/Results
- Email 4: Objection Handling
- Email 5: Scarcity/Urgency
- Email 6: Final Push
- Email 7: Last Chance

### 4. Re-engagement Sequence
**Purpose**: Win back inactive subscribers

### 5. Abandoned Cart Sequence
**Purpose**: Recover lost sales from people who didn't complete purchase

### 6. Onboarding Sequence (Post-Purchase)
**Purpose**: Ensure successful product adoption, reduce refunds

### 7. Upsell/Cross-Sell Sequence
**Purpose**: Increase customer lifetime value

## Email Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA Framework
```
Attention: Subject line + opening hook
Interest: Build curiosity with story or insight
Desire: Show transformation and benefits
Action: Clear, singular CTA
```

### PAS Framework
```
Problem: Identify specific pain point
Agitate: Amplify pain using intensification technique (vivid emotional language)
Solution: Present your offer as the answer
```

### Reciprocation Sequence Framework (Cialdini)
Apply this across email sequences to create psychological obligation:
```
Email 1-2: Give pure value, NO ask
Email 3-4: Continue value + soft mention of solution
Email 5: Now introduce offer (they feel obligated to reciprocate)
```

**Key**: Early emails must be genuinely helpful with zero sales pitch. This creates debt they subconsciously want to repay.

### The Story Framework
```
Setup: Establish relatable situation
Conflict: Introduce problem/challenge
Resolution: Show how problem was solved
Application: How they can apply this
```

### The Value Bomb
```
Hook: Attention-grabbing opening
Value: Deliver genuine, actionable insight
Connection: Relate it to their situation
CTA: Natural next step
```

## Subject Line Formulas

### High-Open Rate Formulas

**1. Curiosity Gap:**
```
"The one thing holding you back from [outcome]..."
"Why [common belief] is actually hurting you"
"I made a mistake (and you might be making it too)"
```

**2. Personalization:**
```
"[Name], quick question for you"
"[Name], this reminded me of you"
"Thoughts on this, [Name]?"
```

**3. Numbers/Lists:**
```
"5 ways to [achieve outcome]"
"The 3 biggest mistakes [avatar] make"
"7 signs you're ready for [next level]"
```

**4. Direct Benefit:**
```
"Get [specific result] in [timeframe]"
"How to [outcome] without [obstacle]"
"[Outcome] made simple"
```

**5. Fear/Loss Aversion:**
```
"Don't make this costly mistake..."
"You're losing [money/time/opportunity] every day"
"Warning: [common action] could be hurting you"
```

**6. Intrigue/Pattern Interrupt:**
```
"This is weird..."
"Okay, I'm confused..."
"Um... wow."
```

**7. Social Proof:**
```
"How [Name] got [specific result]"
"[Number] people did this and got [outcome]"
"Case study: [specific result] in [timeframe]"
```

**8. Question Hook:**
```
"Are you making this mistake?"
"Want to know the secret to [outcome]?"
"Is [common problem] holding you back?"
```

### Subject Line Best Practices
- Keep under 50 characters (mobile optimization)
- **Apply I = B + C formula**: Include both benefit AND curiosity
- Avoid spam trigger words (free, guaranteed, act now, $$$)
- Use emojis sparingly and only if on-brand
- Test personalization (first name)
- Create curiosity without clickbait
- Match subject line promise in email body
- **Consider "because" clause formula**: "You need to see this because..." (increases opens)
