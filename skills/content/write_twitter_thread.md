# Write Twitter/X Threads

## Skill Overview
Create high-velocity Twitter threads that capture attention, deliver density of value, and drive traffic. Unlike LinkedIn, Twitter requires speed, density, and "hot takes."

## When to Use This Skill
-   Condensing a complex topic (like a VSL) into skimmable insights.
-   Sharing "Real-time" learnings or experiments.
-   Newsjacking (commenting on a trending topic).

## Prerequisites
-   **The "Golden Nugget"**: You need one specific, high-value insight. Fluff does not work on Twitter.

## The Thread Anatomy

### 1. The Hook Tweet (Tweet 1)
This is 80% of the battle. If they don't stop scrolling, the thread dies.
**Proven Hook Formats:**
-   **The "How I" Hook:** "I spent $50k on ads. Here are 10 things I learned."
-   **The "Listicle" Hook:** "10 AI tools that are illegal to know. 🧵"
-   **The "Contrarian" Hook:** "SEO is dead. Here is what replaced it."
-   **The "Curiosity" Hook:** "He built a $1B company in 4 years. Without employees. Here is the breakdown."

**Rules:**
-   Keep it under 280 chars (obviously).
-   End with "🧵" or "A breakdown 🧵" to signal it's a thread.
-   Include an image/chart if possible (triples engagement).

### 2. The Body Tweets (The Value)
**Structure:**
-   **1 Idea Per Tweet:** Do not cram multiple points into one tweet.
-   **Bullet Points:** Use simple bullets (- or •).
-   **Visuals:** Alternate text-only tweets with tweets containing charts/screenshots.

**Drafting Style:**
-   Subject + Verb + Object.
-   Remove all adverbs.
-   Be punchy.
-   *Bad:* "You should probably try to think about doing X."
-   *Good:* "Do X."

### 3. The "Mid-Thread CTA" (Tweet 4 or 5)
(Optional) If the thread is long, drop a soft CTA in the middle while attention is high.
-   *Example:* "I share more tips like this in my newsletter. Link in bio."

### 4. The Summary Tweet
The penultimate tweet should summarize the main points.
-   "TL;DR:
    1. Point 1
    2. Point 2
    3. Point 3"
This gets Retweeted the most (high save value).

### 5. The CTA / Plug Tweet (The End)
The final tweet asks for two things:
1.  **A Follow:** "If you liked this, follow @[Handle] for more."
2.  **A Retweet:** "RT the first tweet to share with friends."
3.  **The Offer:** "I help agencies do this. DM me 'SCALE'."

## Repurposing Workflow (YouTube -> Twitter)
1.  **Identify the Core Steps:** Extract the 5-7 main steps from the video.
2.  **Draft the Hook:** Use the Video Title as a base but make it "punchier."
3.  **Draft Body:** Turn each "Step" into 1 Tweet.
    -   *Video:* 2-minute explanation of cold email.
    -   *Tweet:* "Step 1: Cold Email. Don't sell. Ask for interest. Here is the script: [Image of Script]."
4.  **Add Visuals:** Take screenshots from the video and attach them to relevant tweets.

## AI Prompt Instructions
When using AI to write threads:
1.  **Forbid Hashtags:** explicitly say "Do not use hashtags." They look spammy on X.
2.  **Forbid Emojis (mostly):** "Use minimal emojis. No rocket ships."
3.  **Enforce Lowercase:** "Don't Capitalize Every Word Like A Headline. Write like a human."
