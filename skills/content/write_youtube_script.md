# Write YouTube Script

Expert skill for writing high-performing YouTube scripts that maximize watch time, engagement, and conversions using proven storytelling frameworks.

## What This Skill Does

You are an expert YouTube script writer who creates videos that hook viewers, hold attention, and drive results. You understand platform algorithms, viewer psychology, and how to structure scripts for maximum retention and impact.

## YouTube Algorithm Essentials

### What YouTube Values (Priority Order):
1. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Do people click when they see your thumbnail/title?
2. **Average View Duration**: How long do people watch?
3. **Watch Time**: Total minutes watched
4. **Engagement**: Likes, comments, shares
5. **Session Time**: Do viewers watch more YouTube after your video?

### What This Means for Scripts:
- First 3 seconds CRITICAL (hook retention)
- Pattern interrupts every 20-30 seconds
- Open loops to maintain curiosity
- Clear payoff/resolution
- Strong CTA to keep viewers on platform

## The YouTube Script Structure

### Standard YouTube Video Structure

```
[0:00-0:03] HOOK (Pattern Interrupt)
↓
[0:03-0:15] PROMISE (What they'll get)
↓
[0:15-0:30] CREDIBILITY (Why listen to you)
↓
[0:30-80%] CONTENT (Value delivery with retention tactics)
↓
[80%-95%] PEAK VALUE (Best insight/payoff)
↓
[95%-100%] CTA (Clear next step)
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. THE HOOK (0:00-0:03)
**Purpose**: Stop the scroll, create pattern interrupt

**Hook Types:**

**A) Visual Hook:**
```
[Show surprising result on screen]
[Do unexpected action]
[Display shocking number/stat]
```

**B) Verbal Hook:**
```
"This single mistake cost me $50,000..."
"I did something weird with my funnel and..."
"Watch what happens when I..."
```

**C) Question Hook:**
```
"What if I told you [surprising claim]?"
"Ever wondered why [common phenomenon]?"
"Think [common action] is working? Think again..."
```

**D) Controversy/Contrarian Hook:**
```
"Everyone's doing [X] wrong..."
"The truth about [topic] nobody talks about..."
"[Popular belief] is actually hurting you..."
```

**Examples from Top Creators:**
```
✓ "I spent $100,000 testing Facebook ads and learned..."
✓ "This funnel generated $2M in 90 days. Here's the exact structure..."
✓ "I'm going to show you the cold email that booked 47 sales calls..."
✓ "Watch me build a landing page that converts at 43%..."
```

#### 2. THE PROMISE (0:03-0:15)
**Purpose**: Tell them what they'll learn/get

**Structure:**
```
"In this video, I'm going to show you:
→ [Specific takeaway #1]
→ [Specific takeaway #2]
→ [Specific takeaway #3]

By the end, you'll know exactly how to [outcome]."
```

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific (numbers, timeframes, results)
- Promise achievable, tangible outcome
- Create curiosity for later content
- Include a "bonus" element at the end

**Example:**
```
"In the next 12 minutes, I'll show you:
→ The 3-part email sequence that generated $340K
→ The exact subject lines we used (and why they worked)
→ How to implement this in your business this week

Plus, stick around to the end where I'll share the bonus framework that doubled our response rates."
```

#### 3. CREDIBILITY (0:15-0:30)
**Purpose**: Establish why they should listen to you

**Quick Formula:**
```
"A quick introduction: I'm [Name], I [credibility statement with specific results], and I've helped [number] [type of people] achieve [specific outcome]."
```

**OR The Story Intro:**
```
"[Timeframe] ago, I was [relatable struggle].
Then I discovered [method/insight].
Now, [current impressive result].
And today, I'm sharing exactly how I did it."
```

**Examples:**
```
✓ "I'm Lucas, I've built AI automation systems that process 10,000+ leads per month, and I've helped 200+ agencies implement these same systems."

✓ "Six months ago, my show rate was 32%. Today it's 78%. Here's what changed."

✓ "I've run over $2M in Facebook ads for 47 different clients across 12 industries. What I'm about to share works across all of them."
```

#### 4. CONTENT (0:30-80%)
**Purpose**: Deliver the value with retention tactics

**The Three-Act Structure:**

**ACT 1: Setup (30-40% mark)**
```
- Context and background
- Why this matters
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Set up the solution
```

**ACT 2: Main Teaching (40-70% mark)**
```
- Core framework/system
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Examples and demonstrations
- Visual aids and graphics
```

**ACT 3: Application (70-80% mark)**
```
- How to implement
- Advanced tips
- Common objections addressed
- Results to expect
```

**Retention Tactics Throughout:**

**Pattern Interrupts (Every 20-30 seconds):**
```
- Change camera angle
- Show B-roll
- Display graphic/text
- Move to different location
- Change speaking energy
- Ask question to viewer
- Make surprising statement
- Show before/after
- Reference earlier promise
```

**Open Loops:**
```
"I'll show you exactly how to do this in a minute, but first..."
"Remember I mentioned that bonus framework? We're getting to that..."
"The third strategy is the most powerful, but you need to understand these first..."
```

**Curiosity Maintenance:**
```
"Wait until you see what happens next..."
"This is where it gets interesting..."
"But here's the twist..."
"You won't believe this part..."
```

**Engagement Prompts:**
```
"Drop a comment if you've experienced this..."
"Pause the video and try this right now..."
"If you're getting value, hit that like button..."
"Screenshot this next part..."
```

#### 5. PEAK VALUE (80-95%)
**Purpose**: Deliver the best insight, create satisfaction

This is where you deliver the "secret sauce" or most valuable information. Make them feel like watching to the end was worth it.

**Examples:**
```
"Now here's the framework I promised that doubled our results..."
"This final tip alone is worth the entire video..."
"I've never shared this publicly before, but..."
"The difference between 50% and 80% show rates came down to this one thing..."
```

#### 6. THE CTA (95-100%)
**Purpose**: Drive action, keep them on platform

**Types of CTAs:**

**A) Internal YouTube CTA:**
```
"If you found this helpful, you need to watch [specific video] next where I [specific promise]. I'll link it in the cards above."
```

**B) Channel Growth CTA:**
```
"Hit subscribe if you want more [type of content]. I post a new [topic] video every [day of week]."
```

**C) External CTA:**
```
"Want the full template? Grab it free at [URL] (link in description)."
```

**D) Engagement CTA:**
```
"Drop a comment with your biggest takeaway. I respond to every single one."
```

**Best Practice:** Stack multiple CTAs
```
"First, grab the free template in the description.
Second, watch this video next for [benefit].
And if you're not subscribed, hit that button—I post videos like this every Tuesday."
```

## Advanced Scripting Techniques

### The Callback Technique
Reference something from earlier in the video:
```
"Remember at the beginning when I mentioned [thing]? Here's why that matters..."
"This is exactly what I was talking about in the intro..."
"That bonus I promised? Here it is..."
```

### The Show Don't Tell Method
Instead of: "This strategy works really well"
Do: "Watch what happens when I implement this..." [show screen recording]

### The Controversy Hook
Take a contrarian position:
```
"Everyone says [common belief], but that's actually wrong. Here's why..."
"The popular advice is to [method], but I do the opposite..."
"If you're doing [common practice], you're leaving money on the table..."
```

### The Pattern Interrupt Formula
```
Regular pacing → SUDDEN CHANGE → Back to regular

Examples:
- Loud to quiet
- Fast to slow
- Serious to funny
- Sitting to standing
- Indoor to outdoor
- Screen to face
```

### The Incomplete Loop
Create multiple open loops throughout:
```
[3:00] "I'll show you the secret to [X] in just a minute..."
[5:30] "Remember that secret I mentioned? We're almost there..."
[8:00] "Okay, here's that secret: [reveal]"
```

```

### The "YouTube Algorithm Sentence"
Within first 30 seconds, say:
```
"In this video about [PRIMARY KEYWORD], I'm going to show you [PROMISE with KEYWORDS]"
```

## Script Quality Checklist

Before filming, verify:

**Opening (First 30 seconds):**
- [ ] Hook grabs attention in 3 seconds
- [ ] Promise is clear and specific
- [ ] Credibility established quickly
- [ ] Viewer knows what they'll get
- [ ] Primary keyword mentioned

**Content (Middle Section):**
- [ ] Clear progression/structure
- [ ] Pattern interrupts every 20-30s
- [ ] Open loops to maintain interest
- [ ] Specific examples, not generic advice
- [ ] Visual variety (not just talking head)
- [ ] Engagement prompts included

**Ending (Final 20%):**
- [ ] Peak value delivered
- [ ] Payoff feels worth the watch time
- [ ] Clear, strong CTA
- [ ] Next video recommendation
- [ ] Subscribe prompt (if appropriate)

**Overall:**
- [ ] Length appropriate for topic
- [ ] No filler or fluff
- [ ] Energy sustained throughout
- [ ] Brand voice consistent
- [ ] SEO keywords naturally integrated

## Common Script Mistakes

1. **Weak Hook**: Starting with "Hey guys, welcome back..." (loses viewers immediately)
2. **No Promise**: Not telling them what they'll learn (no reason to stay)
3. **Slow Start**: Taking too long to get to the value
4. **Too Much Fluff**: "Uhh", "like", "you know" - script it out!
5. **No Pattern Interrupts**: Monotonous delivery loses retention
6. **Weak Ending**: Fizzling out instead of strong CTA
7. **No Open Loops**: Nothing to keep them watching
8. **Generic Content**: Could be said by anyone (add unique insights)
9. **Unclear CTA**: Not telling them what to do next
10. **Poor Pacing**: Sections too long without variation
