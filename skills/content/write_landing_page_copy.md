# Write Landing Page Copy

Expert skill for writing high-converting landing page copy that follows best practices and maintains message congruency from ad to conversion.

## What This Skill Does

You are an expert landing page copywriter who creates pages that convert cold traffic into leads and customers. You understand funnel psychology, message matching, and the anatomy of winning funnels.

## Core Principles of Landing Page Copy

### 1. Congruency is King
**The #1 rule**: Your landing page must say the SAME thing as your ad.

### 2. Cialdini's 6 Influence Weapons for Landing Pages

Apply these proven psychological principles systematically:

1. **Reciprocation**: Give value upfront (free training, resource, tool)
2. **Commitment & Consistency**: Get micro-commitments (watch video, answer qualifier question)
3. **Social Proof**: Show others like them taking action (testimonials, logos, numbers)
4. **Authority**: Establish credibility (credentials, media mentions, results)
5. **Liking**: Build rapport (shared identity, common struggles)
6. **Scarcity**: Create urgency authentically (limited spots, time-based)

**Application**: Every landing page should strategically employ at least 3-4 of these principles.

### 3. Proof > Claims Principle
Lead with proof before making claims. Show evidence immediately, then make your promise.

**Bad**: "We're the best at [X]" → No proof
**Good**: "847 clients achieved [result]" → Then explain why

### 4. Tap Into Pre-Existing Desires
Don't try to create new desires. Identify what your audience already wants and channel it toward your solution.

**Common Fears to Address:** Unknown, embarrassment, failure, poverty/loss, dependence
**Common Desires to Tap:** Freedom, success, acceptance, peace of mind, optimism

### 5. The Power of One
Focus on ONE message, ONE avatar, ONE pain point, ONE solution.

**Before (Confusing):**
"We help you invest in multifamily real estate AND drop your taxes with advanced tax strategies"
→ Requires finding someone who wants BOTH things

**After (Clear):**
"Find your first multifamily property that generates passive monthly cashflow"
→ Clear, singular focus

### 6. Mobile-First Design
- 70%+ of traffic is mobile
- All key elements above the fold on mobile
- Clean, uncluttered design
- Fast loading times
- Easy to read on small screens

## Landing Page Structure & Copy Elements

### Standard VSL/Webinar Funnel Structure

```
1. HEADLINE
   ↓
2. SUB-HEADLINE
   ↓
3. VIDEO (VSL/Webinar)
   ↓
4. BUTTON / FORM
   ↓
5. SUPPORTING COPY (optional)
   ↓
6. SOCIAL PROOF
   ↓
7. FINAL CTA
```

### Element-by-Element Breakdown

#### 1. HEADLINE (Above the Fold)
The headline is your landing page hook. It must match your ad messaging.

**Formula:**
```
[Specific outcome] for [specific avatar] without [common obstacle]

OR

How to [achieve desired result] in [timeframe] even if [objection/situation]
```

**Examples:**
```
✓ "Get 75%+ Show Rates Without Increasing Your Ad Spend"
✓ "Find Your First Multifamily Property in 90 Days"
✓ "Scale Your Cold Email Campaign to $1M/Year Using Only Organic Content"

✗ "Grow Your Business" (too generic)
✗ "Marketing Solutions for Everyone" (no specificity)
```

#### 2. SUB-HEADLINE
Adds context and expands on the promise. Overcomes the first objection.

**Formula:**
```
[Expand on benefit] + [Remove objection] + [Qualify the reader]
```

**Examples:**
```
"A proven 3-step system that works even if you've never run ads before"
"Watch this free 10-minute training to discover the exact funnel structure that generated $2.3M for our clients"
"Perfect for coaches, consultants, and agency owners doing $10K-$50K/month"
```

#### 3. VIDEO / VSL
The main conversion mechanism. Your copy supports this.

**Video Intro Copy (if applicable):**
```
"In this [length] video, you'll discover:
→ [Specific learning 1]
→ [Specific learning 2]
→ [Specific learning 3]"
```

#### 4. PRIMARY CTA BUTTON
**Best Practices:**
- Use action-oriented text
- Explain what happens next
- Remove friction

**Button Copy Examples:**
```
✓ "Yes! Reserve My Seat"
✓ "Watch The Free Training Now"
✓ "Get The Funnel Blueprint"
✓ "Schedule My Strategy Call"

✗ "Submit" (no excitement)
✗ "Click Here" (vague)
✗ "Buy Now" (too aggressive for cold traffic)
```

**Below Button Micro-Copy:**
```
"No credit card required"
"Watch in under 15 minutes"
"Instant access"
"100% Free Training"
```

```

• [Consequence #2]
• [Consequence #3]

But here's what's possible when you [implement solution]:

```
"Our clients have:
→ Generated $47M+ in combined revenue
→ Booked 12,847 qualified sales calls
→ Achieved an average 78% show rate"
```

## Design & Layout Best Practices

### Above The Fold Checklist
- [ ] Headline clearly visible
- [ ] Sub-headline provides context
- [ ] Primary CTA button visible
- [ ] Clean, uncluttered design
- [ ] Mobile optimized
- [ ] Video player (if applicable) loads quickly

### Mobile Optimization
```
Essential Mobile Requirements:

1. Headline: Large, readable font (30-36px min)
2. Button: Minimum 44x44px touch target
3. Form fields: Large enough to tap easily
4. Spacing: Adequate white space between elements
5. Load speed: Under 3 seconds
6. No horizontal scrolling
```

### Color Psychology for CTAs
- **Orange/Red**: Urgency, action (highest conversion)
- **Green**: Safety, go, positive
- **Blue**: Trust, stability (use for VSLs/webinars)
- **Purple**: Premium, luxury
- **Yellow**: Attention, caution (use sparingly)

**Contrast Rule**: CTA button must have high contrast with background (70%+ contrast ratio)

## Copywriting Techniques

### 1. Future Pacing
Help them see the transformation:
```
"Imagine waking up to 15 new qualified leads in your inbox...
Imagine closing 3-5 new clients per month consistently...
Imagine having the freedom to take Fridays off..."
```

### 2. Pain Agitation
Before promising the solution, twist the knife:
```
"You're working 60+ hour weeks...
Your pipeline is inconsistent...
You're one bad month away from disaster...
And you KNOW there's a better way..."
```

### 3. Pattern Interrupts
Break their scroll/reading pattern:
```
"Wait—before you leave this page..."
"Here's the truth nobody's telling you..."
"Stop. Read this if you're serious about [outcome]..."
```

### 4. Social Proof Integration
Weave it throughout, not just in one section:
```
"Over 2,847 agency owners have used this exact system..."
"Join [Name], [Name], and [Name] who are already getting results..."
```

### 5. Specificity Wins
Generic vs Specific:
```
✗ "Grow your business"
✓ "Add $15K-$30K MRR in the next 90 days"

✗ "Get more leads"
✓ "Generate 50-100 qualified leads per month"

✗ "Improve your funnel"
✓ "Increase your show rate from 40% to 75%"
```

Product/Service: [description]
Target Avatar: [specific details]
Main Pain Point: [what keeps them up at night]

Ad Messaging (must match): [paste ad copy]

3. "What You'll Learn" section (4-5 bullet points)
4. "Who This Is For" section
5. Social proof section (format 3 testimonials)
6. Final CTA section

Use the power of one principle. Keep the message congruent with the ad. Make it benefit-driven, not feature-focused.
```

### Optimize Existing Landing Page
```
Here's my current landing page copy:
[paste copy]

And here's my ad copy:
[paste ad copy]

Analyze this landing page against these criteria:

3. Mobile optimization: Is the copy clean and scannable?
4. CTA clarity: Are the buttons and next steps clear?

Provide:
- Specific issues identified

```

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing any landing page:

**Message Congruency:**
- [ ] Headline matches ad messaging
- [ ] Same pain points addressed
- [ ] Same language and tone used
- [ ] Same outcome promised

**Copy Quality:**
- [ ] Follows power of one principle
- [ ] Specific, not generic
- [ ] Benefit-driven, not feature-focused
- [ ] Includes strong social proof
- [ ] Clear, friction-free CTAs

**Design & Layout:**
- [ ] Mobile optimized

- [ ] Clean, professional design

**Conversion Elements:**
- [ ] Multiple CTA opportunities
- [ ] Risk reversal statements
- [ ] Urgency/scarcity (if applicable)
- [ ] Clear value proposition
- [ ] Objection handling

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Incongruent Messaging**: Ad says one thing, page says another
2. **Multiple Messages**: Trying to sell too many things at once
3. **Feature Dumping**: Listing features instead of benefits
4. **Weak Headlines**: Generic, unclear headlines that don't match ads
5. **Hidden CTAs**: Buttons not visible or unclear
6. **Mobile Disaster**: Not testing on mobile devices
7. **No Social Proof**: Missing testimonials and results
8. **Confusing Navigation**: Too many options causing decision paralysis
9. **Wall of Text**: Not breaking up copy for scannability
10. **No Risk Reversal**: Not addressing concerns or objections

## Advanced Strategies

### The Slippery Slide Technique
Each element should slide the reader to the next:
1. Headline → Sub-headline
2. Sub-headline → Video
3. Video → Button
4. Button → Testimonials
5. Testimonials → Final CTA

### Micro-Commitments
Ask for small yeses before the big yes:
- "Sound interesting?"
- "Want to learn how?"
- "Ready to see the results?"

### The Bucket Brigade
Use transitional phrases to maintain reading momentum:
- "Here's the thing..."
- "But there's more..."
- "Get this..."
- "And that's not all..."

### Scarcity Ladder (Most to Least Effective)

Apply Cialdini's scarcity principle systematically:

**1. HARD SCARCITY (Highest Conversion)**
- "Only 12 spots available"
- "We close enrollment May 15th"
- Countdown timers showing time remaining
- **Application**: Use for limited capacity offers

**2. SOCIAL SCARCITY**
- "487 people have already joined"
- "We're at 80% capacity"
- "Join 2,847 other [avatars] who..."
- **Application**: Combines social proof + scarcity

**3. ADVANTAGE SCARCITY**
- "Early birds get [bonus]"
- "After May 15th, price increases to $[X]"
- "First 50 registrants receive..."
- **Application**: Rewards fast action without hard limits

**Best Practice**: Use authentic scarcity only. False scarcity kills trust and conversions long-term.

### The "Because" Trigger Word

Insert "because" statements throughout copy to activate automatic compliance:
- "Book your call now because spots fill up within 48 hours..."
- "This training is free because we want to prove our system works..."
- "We limit to 12 clients because we personally oversee every account..."

**Application**: Every CTA should include a "because" statement.

### Exit Intent Optimization
For pages with exit-intent popups:
```
Headline: "Wait! Before You Go..."
Sub: "What if you could [outcome] in just [timeframe]?"
CTA: "Give Me One More Chance To Show You"
```

## Integration with Other Skills

- Pair with `/write-ad-copy` for perfect message match
- Use `/write-email-sequence` for follow-up sequences
- Reference `/write-vsl-script` for VSL funnel pages
- Apply `/generate-content-with-ai` for rapid iteration

---

**Remember**: The best landing pages feel like a natural continuation of the ad. If the visitor has to think "Wait, is this the same thing?", you've lost them. Congruency + Specificity + Clarity = Conversions.
