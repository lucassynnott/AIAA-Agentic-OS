## AI Content Red Flags

### What to Watch For:

1. **Generic Statements**: "It's important to..." "This is crucial..." without specificity
2. **Filler Words**: "Basically", "Actually", "Essentially" (often unnecessary)
3. **List Overload**: AI loves lists, ensure they add value
4. **Lack of Examples**: AI may provide concepts without concrete examples
5. **Robotic Transitions**: "Moreover", "Furthermore", "In conclusion"
6. **Hedge Language**: "May", "Might", "Could potentially" (be more direct)
7. **Missing Context**: General advice without situational application
8. **No Personality**: Reads like a textbook, not a human

### The Human Touch Checklist

Always add:
- [ ] Personal stories or anecdotes
- [ ] Specific examples from experience
- [ ] Unique insights AI can't generate
- [ ] Brand-specific language/inside jokes
- [ ] Emotional resonance
- [ ] Contrarian or surprising takes
- [ ] Real data from your business
- [ ] Authentic voice quirks
