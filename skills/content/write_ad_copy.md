# Write FB/IG Ad Copy

Expert skill for writing high-converting Facebook and Instagram ad copy using proven frameworks and strategies.

## What This Skill Does

You are an expert Facebook and Instagram ad copywriter who creates scroll-stopping ad copy that drives conversions. You understand the anatomy of winning ads and can craft hyper-contextual messaging that resonates with cold traffic.

## Core Copywriting Frameworks

### 1. AIDA Framework
- **Attention**: Stop the scroll with a powerful hook
- **Interest**: Build curiosity and engagement
- **Desire**: Create emotional connection and need
- **Action**: Clear, direct call-to-action

### 2. PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
- **Problem**: Identify the specific pain point
- **Agitate**: Amplify the pain and consequences using **intensification technique**
- **Solution**: Present your offer as the answer

### 3. Interest = Benefit + Curiosity Formula (I = B + C)
Headlines and hooks need BOTH to grab attention:
- **Benefit**: Clear promise of what they'll gain
- **Curiosity**: Unpredictability or gap in knowledge

**Bad Hook**: "Grow your agency" (benefit only, no curiosity)
**Good Hook**: "The counter-intuitive strategy that 2X'd our agency revenue" (benefit + curiosity)

### 4. Contrast Principle
Present options in sequence so your offer stands out by comparison.
- "Most agencies spend $10K/mo on ads and get 5 leads..."
- "We spent $0 on ads and got 47 qualified calls in 30 days"

### 5. The Red Shirt Principle
Focus on perfecting ONE element instead of optimizing everything at once.
- Test ONE new hook at a time
- Perfect ONE pain point angle before testing others
- Don't change hook + body + CTA simultaneously

### 6. The Hook-Body-CTA Structure
This is the primary framework for high-performing ads:

**HOOK (First 1-2 lines)**
- Call out hyper-specific pain points, desires, or situations
- **Apply I = B + C formula**: Include both benefit and curiosity
- **Tap into pre-existing desires** (don't create new ones)
- Use proof statements (**Proof > Claims**: lead with evidence)
- Be contextual to what they're experiencing RIGHT NOW
- **Target specific emotions**: 10 fears or 8 desires (see Emotional Targeting below)
- Example: "Are you struggling to get your show rates above 75%? Every time prospects show up to calls (if they do at all), they're cold, guarded, and throwing objections..."

**BODY (Supporting content)**
- **Why it occurs**: Explain the problem or pain point
- **Use "because" statements** for compliance triggers
- **The solution**: Your product/service
- **Outcome/Proof**: What results they'll get (proof before claims)
- Keep it conversational and native to the platform
- **Intensification technique**: Use vivid, emotional language when agitating problems

**CTA (Clear next steps)**
- Tell them exactly what to do next
- **Include "because" statement**: Explain why they should act
- Explain what's on the next page (pre-frame)
- **Apply scarcity principle** when authentic (limited spots, time-based)
- Example: "Click the button below because we only work with 12 clients per quarter. You'll be taken to a quick page with a 5-10 minute video that explains everything about our offer and how we can help you. Then you can schedule a call to see if this is a fit."

## Emotional Targeting for Ads

Before writing ad copy, identify which pre-existing emotions your audience experiences:

### 10 Common Fears to Target in Ad Hooks
- **Unknown**: "Not knowing if your funnel is actually working..."
- **Embarrassment**: "Watching competitors land clients while you struggle..."
- **Failure**: "Missing targets month after month..."
- **Poverty/Loss**: "$10K/month on ads with almost nothing to show for it..."
- **Dependence**: "Stuck relying on referrals that dry up randomly..."
- **Betrayal**: "Agencies that ghosted you after taking your money..."

### 8 Common Desires to Tap Into
- **Freedom**: "Control over your revenue without being glued to your phone..."
- **Success**: "Consistently hitting $50K months..."
- **Acceptance**: "Finally getting recognized as an authority..."
- **Peace of Mind**: "Knowing your pipeline is full without constant hustle..."
- **Optimism**: "Clear path to 7 figures..."

### Application in Ad Copy
**Hook**: Lead with fear or desire
**Body**: Intensify the emotion, then show path to desire fulfillment
**Proof**: Demonstrate others achieved the desire
**CTA**: Final push using urgency

**Example:**
- Hook taps into Fear of Unknown: "Not sure if your ads are even working?"
- Body intensifies: "You're spending $5K/month but have no idea which ad, which audience, or which message is actually converting..."
- Solution channels toward Desire for Peace of Mind: "Get a dashboard that shows you exactly what's working in real-time..."

## Ad Copy Best Practices

### Messaging Principles
1. **Be Hyper-Specific**: Don't say "struggling with sales" - say "struggling to get prospects to show up warm and ready to buy"
2. **Articulate Their Problem Better Than They Can**: Demonstrate deep understanding
3. **One Message Per Ad**: Power of one - don't confuse with multiple ideas
4. **Real-Time Relevance**: Address what they're experiencing RIGHT NOW
5. **Avoid Generic Call-Outs**: "Coaches, agencies, and consultants" doesn't work anymore
6. **Tap Into Pre-Existing Desires**: Don't try to create new desires - identify existing ones

### Visual & Environment Considerations
- **Match Your Environment to Your Offer**: If targeting contractors, film outside Home Depot with your truck, not in a studio
- **Quality Matters**: Good camera and audio quality (audio is MORE important than video)
- **Native to Platform**: 9:16 for Reels/Stories, 4:5 for Feed, 16:9 for YouTube
- **Visual Disruptors**: Use props, whiteboards, flip charts to grab attention
- **Confident Delivery**: Speak confidently on camera

## Ad Types & Templates

### 1. Pain Point Ad
```
Hook: [Specific pain point question]
Are you struggling to [specific problem with specific metrics]?

Body:
Here's why this happens: [explanation]
Here's how to fix it: [your solution]
Here's what you'll get: [specific outcome]

CTA:

You'll be taken to [describe next page] where you can [next action].
```

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Facebook/Instagram Feed
- Length: 100-150 words is ideal
- Format: Break into short 1-2 line paragraphs
- Emojis: Use sparingly, only if on-brand
- First 2 lines CRITICAL (before "See More")

### Instagram Stories/Reels
- Shorter, punchier copy
- Text overlays for key points
- Strong visual hook in first 3 seconds
- Clear single CTA

### Retargeting vs Cold Traffic
**Cold Traffic:**
- More context needed
- Longer warm-up
- Focus on pain points
- Build trust first

**Retargeting:**
- Can be more direct
- Reference previous interaction
- Stronger/faster CTA
- Less explanation needed

## AI Prompts for Ad Copy

### Generate Ad Variations
```
I need 5 Facebook ad copy variations for [product/service].

Target Audience: [specific avatar]
Main Pain Point: [specific problem]
Key Benefit: [transformation]
Proof: [testimonial/result if available]

Use the Hook-Body-CTA structure. Make the hook hyper-specific to their real-time pain points. Keep it under 150 words. Use the PAS framework to agitate the problem before presenting the solution.

Format each ad clearly with:
HOOK:
BODY:
CTA:
```

### Improve Existing Ad Copy
```
Here's my current ad copy:
[paste copy]

Analyze this using these criteria:
1. Is the hook specific enough? Does it call out a real-time pain point?
2. Does the body support the hook and lead to the solution naturally?
3. Is the CTA clear and does it explain what's on the next page?
4. Is it following the "power of one" principle (one message, one audience)?

Provide:
- Specific feedback on what's working/not working
- 2 rewritten versions with improvements
- A/B test suggestions
```

### Create Hook Variations
```
Product/Service: [description]
Target Avatar: [specific details]
Main Pain Point: [what keeps them up at night]

Generate 10 different ad hooks using these approaches:
1. Pain point question (specific)
2. Proof statement (with numbers)
3. Mistake/warning
4. Contrarian take
5. Story opening
6. "Are you" qualification
7. Time-based urgency
8. Big promise
9. Enemy/villain approach
10. Case study preview

Each hook should be 1-2 sentences maximum and hyper-specific.
```

## Ad Copy Examples (Winning Formulas)

### Example 1: Show Rate Problem
```
HOOK:
Are you struggling to get prospects to show up to your sales calls actually warm and ready to buy? Every time they show up—if they do at all—they're cold, guarded, and throwing out objections?

BODY:
This happens because your funnel isn't pre-framing them properly before the call. Here's how we fix it: We build VSL funnels that educate and warm up your prospects BEFORE they ever hop on a call with you. The result? 75%+ show rates with prospects who already trust you and are ready to buy.

CTA:
If this sounds like what you need, click the button below. You'll be taken to a quick page with a 10-minute video that explains our entire process and how we can help you fix your show rates. Then you can book a call to see if this is a fit.
```

### Example 2: Proof-Led
```
HOOK:
We sent 150,000 cold emails for [Client Name], generated 892 qualified appointments, and closed $340K in new revenue in 90 days.

BODY:
Here's exactly what we did:
- Built a targeted list of 50,000 ideal prospects
- Crafted 12 different email sequences using our PAIN framework
- A/B tested subject lines and CTAs across 6 campaigns
- Followed up with personalized video messages for high-intent leads

The result? A 2.8% response rate and 43% booking rate.

## Quality Checklist

Before launching any ad, verify:

- [ ] Hook is hyper-specific (not generic)
- [ ] Applies I = B + C formula (benefit + curiosity in hook)
- [ ] Addresses real-time pain points or desires
- [ ] Taps into pre-existing emotion (10 fears or 8 desires)
- [ ] Leads with proof before claims
- [ ] Body supports the hook naturally
- [ ] Includes at least 1 "because" statement
- [ ] Uses intensification technique in problem agitation
- [ ] Clear value proposition communicated
- [ ] CTA tells them exactly what's next with "because" reason
- [ ] Explains what's on the next page (pre-frame)
- [ ] Applies scarcity principle if authentic
- [ ] Native to platform format
- [ ] Avoids common pitfalls (too broad, confusing, multiple messages)
- [ ] Congruent with landing page message
- [ ] Follows "power of one" principle (one message, one emotion, one CTA)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Generic**: "Coaches, agencies, consultants - I'll help you 4-5X your leads" (doesn't work)
2. **Multiple Messages**: Trying to talk about too many things in one ad
3. **No Specificity**: Not getting granular with problems and solutions
4. **Weak CTA**: Just saying "click to learn more" without context
5. **Incongruent Messaging**: Ad says one thing, landing page says another
6. **Ignoring Visual Quality**: Poor audio/video quality kills trust
7. **Wrong Environment**: Looking like an "info marketer" when targeting contractors

## Advanced Techniques

### The "Here's Why" Pattern
After stating a problem, add credibility by explaining why it happens. This builds trust and positions you as an expert.

### The Pre-Frame
Tell them what they'll see on the next page. This reduces friction and jarring transitions.

### Proof Stacking
Layer multiple forms of proof (numbers, testimonials, case studies) throughout the copy.

### The Scroll Stopper Formula
[Specific result] + [Specific timeframe] + without [Common obstacle] = Instant credibility

Example: "I built a $300K/month agency in 6 months without spending a dollar on ads"

## Testing & Optimization

### What to Test
1. Different hooks (pain vs proof vs story)
2. Copy length (short vs medium vs long)
3. CTA variations
4. Visual formats
5. Different frameworks (AIDA vs PAS vs Hook-Body-CTA)

### Success Metrics
- Hook Rate (3-second view rate)
- Hold Rate (watch time %)
- CTR (click-through rate)
- CPM/CPC (cost metrics)
- Landing page congruency score

## Integration with Other Skills

- Combine with `/write-landing-page-copy` for congruent messaging
- Use `/write-email-sequence` for retargeting sequences
- Reference `/create-content-calendar` for campaign planning
- Apply frameworks from `/write-youtube-script` for video ads

**Remember**: The best ad copy is hyper-specific, addresses real-time pain points, and makes the prospect feel like you're reading their mind. Generic doesn't work. Specificity wins.
