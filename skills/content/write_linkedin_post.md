## The 3 Proven Formats

### 1. The "Broetry" (Story & Lesson)
**Best for:** Viral reach, personal stories, vulnerability.
**Structure:**
1.  **The Hook (Lines 1-2):** A punchy statement. Short sentences.
    *   *Example:* "I lost $50,000 in one day."
2.  **The Divider:** A visual break (extra whitespace).
3.  **The Context:** Briefly set the scene.
4.  **The Conflict:** What went wrong? Or what is the enemy?
5.  **The Epiphany:** The specific realization.
6.  **The Lesson (The Meat):** 3-5 bullet points of value.
7.  **The CTA:** Ask a question to drive comments.

### 2. The "Technical Breakdown" (Authority)
**Best for:** Generating qualified leads, showing expertise.
**Structure:**
1.  **The Hook:** Data-driven result.
    *   *Example:* "How we added $2M ARR using one 4-step email flow."
2.  **The "Old Way":** Why most people fail.
3.  **The "New Way" (Step-by-Step):**
    *   Step 1: [Detail]
    *   Step 2: [Detail]
    *   Step 3: [Detail]
4.  **The Proof:** Screenshot or image of results.
5.  **The CTA:** "Comment 'FLOW' to see the templates."

### 3. The Carousel (Slide Deck)
**Best for:** Dwell time (Algo boost), saving for later.
**Structure (Text for PDF):**
-   **Slide 1 (Cover):** Big bold text. High contrast. "The AI Agency Playbook."
-   **Slide 2 (The Problem):** "Most agencies are dying."
-   **Slides 3-8 (The Steps):** One concept per slide. Large font.
-   **Slide 9 (Summary):** Cheat sheet of all points.
-   **Slide 10 (Bio & CTA):** "Follow for more."

## Writing Guidelines (The LinkedIn Algorithm Love Language)

### 1. The "See More" Optimization
The first 3 lines are ALL that matter. You must force the click on "...see more".
-   **DO:** Start with a polarizing statement.
-   **DO:** Cut off the sentence right before the payoff.
-   **DON'T:** Start with "Hello connections!" or "So happy to announce."

### 2. Formatting & Whitespace
-   Never write paragraphs longer than 2 lines.
-   Use emojis sparingly (as bullets), not as decoration.
-   Use unicode bold for headers (e.g., 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞).

### 3. Engagement Loops
You need comments in the first hour.
-   **End with a specific question:** "Do you prefer A or B?" (Not "Thoughts?")
-   **Reply to every comment** within the first 60 minutes.

3.  **Check Hook:** Is the first line boring? Rewrite it to be shocking.
