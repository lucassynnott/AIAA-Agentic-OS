## Category 1: Outreach Methods

### Method 1: Mass Automated Outreach

**What it is:** Sending thousands of cold emails per month using automation.

**Tech stack:**
- Domains: Pork Bun
- Inboxes: Microsoft 365
- Sending: SmartLead
- Leads: ListKit

**Key rule:** Max 20 emails per inbox per day.

> **📊 CROSS-REFERENCE: STANDARDIZED COLD EMAIL VOLUME INFRASTRUCTURE (Cross-Reference: SKILL_BIBLE_10m_lead_generation.md)**
> | Daily Volume | Inboxes Required | Calculation | Infrastructure Notes |
> |--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
> | 100/day | 5 inboxes | 20 emails/inbox x 5 = 100 | Beginner setup |
> | 500/day | 25 inboxes | 20 emails/inbox x 25 = 500 | Growing operation |
> | 1,000/day | 50 inboxes | 20 emails/inbox x 50 = 1,000 | Established system |
> | 5,000/day | 250 inboxes | 20 emails/inbox x 250 = 5,000 | Scaled operation |
> | 10,000/day | 500 inboxes | 20 emails/inbox x 500 = 10,000 | Enterprise scale (ListKit level) |
> | Note: Max 20 emails per inbox per day to maintain deliverability. Requires domain warming, multiple sending domains (3-5 inboxes per domain), and proper DNS setup

**Warning:** Only works with offers that have product-market fit. Test with Dream 100 first.

---

### Method 2: Dream 100 Outreach

**What it is:** Manually identifying and messaging 100 perfect prospects.

**Purpose:** Validate product-market fit before mass outreach.

**Process:**
1. List 100 ideal clients
2. Research each one
3. Build genuine relationship
4. Combine with Method 3 (service-based lead magnet)

---

### Method 3: Service-Based Lead Magnet

**What it is:** Doing actual labor for someone as a free gift.

**Different from regular lead magnet:** You CREATE something for them (not just give a PDF).

**Examples:**
- E-commerce email agency: Design a complete email for them
- Content agency: Script and edit one video for them
- Ad agency: Create custom ad strategy document

**Key rule:** Don't ask permission. Just do it and send it.

**Why it works:** When you're a beginner, your only value is labor. Transfer it.

---

### Method 4: Call Your Opt-ins

**What it is:** Having setters call/text people who opted into your funnel.

**Impact:** 40% of calls come from setter follow-up (based on Daniel's data).

**Math:**
- Without setters: $500 cost per call
- With setters: Effectively $300 cost per call

**Pro tip:** Use iPhone for texting (blue bubble = 3-4x higher response rate).

---

### Method 5: Send Loom Videos to Old Leads

**What it is:** Re-engaging leads who didn't close with personalized videos.

**Script:**
```
"Hey [Name], I know we talked a while ago and you said [objection].

Since then, I've worked with [X] more clients and got [results].

Let me walk you through what I'd do for your business specifically..."

[Screen share ROI calculator with their numbers]
```

**Concept:** Squeeze the rag. You paid to get them—extract the value.

---

## Category 2: Content Methods

### Method 6: SEO-Optimized YouTube Videos

**What it is:** Creating videos that rank for search terms.

**Process:**
1. Use VidIQ to find search terms
2. Search term on YouTube
3. Watch existing videos
4. Make a BETTER one (more useful)

**Example results:**
- "$5 Million VSL Script" = 100 views/day, 1 year later
- "Twitter Masterclass" = 50-100 views/day, 2 years later

**Key insight:** In B2B, "better" = more useful, actionable information.

---

### Method 7: Build an Email List

**What it is:** Collecting emails to have free access to an audience.

**Why it matters:**
- YouTube: Algorithm controls exposure
- Ads: Costs money
- Email list: FREE, unlimited access

**Frequency:** 3-5 emails per week.

---

### Method 8: Post on LinkedIn

**What it is:** Repurposing email content as LinkedIn posts.

**Daniel's results:**
- 30-50 new followers/day
- 20,000 impressions/week
- Low effort (repurposed content)

---

### Method 9: Post Case Studies

**What it is:** Sharing any results publicly.

**Best format:** Video interview with client revealing:
1. Who they are (real person proof)
2. Their business
3. What you did
4. Quantifiable results

**Key insight:** Quantity matters. 2 case studies = "worked with 2 clients." 50 case studies = authority.

---

### Method 10: Create Lead Magnets

**What it is:** Giving something valuable in exchange for email.

**Integration:** Put in every YouTube video.
- "Download this doc at [link]"
- They give email
- They join email list
- You increase frequency

---

### Method 11: Interview-Style Short Form Content

**What it is:** Having someone ask you questions on Zoom while camera films.

**Setup:**
1. Camera positioned to film you
2. Zoom call with interviewer
3. They ask questions
4. You answer looking at them
5. Chop into clips
6. Post on LinkedIn/Twitter

---

## Category 3: Advertising Methods

### Method 12: VSL Ad Funnel

**What it is:** Running ads to opt-in → VSL → application → call.

**Daniel's setup:**
- $6,000/day ad spend
- ~60 active ads
- Opt-in collects name/email/phone
- VSL reveals price (filters poor people)
- Application qualifies further
- Only qualified reach calendar

---

### Method 13: Retarget Website Visitors

**What it is:** Showing ads to people who visited your site.

**Setup:**
1. Install Meta pixel
2. Install Google pixel
3. Create audience of visitors
4. Run retargeting ads

**Where to show:**
- Instagram stories
- YouTube pre-roll
- Facebook feed

**Goal:** Increase frequency to 30 touches/week.

---

## Category 4: Relationship Building

### Method 14: Go on Podcasts

**Examples:**

---

### Method 16: Message People Who Engage

Thanks for that! What are you working on?"
```

---

### Method 17: Join Paid Groups and Give Value

**What it is:** Being helpful in communities you've paid to join.

**Why paid groups:**
- People who buy = buyers
- Buyers buy more things
- Non-buyers never buy

**Action:** Answer questions with your expertise. People will reach out.

---

### Method 18: Comment on Other People's Content

**What it is:** Adding value to others' posts.

**Goal:** Get noticed by "cool kids table" (influential people in your niche).

**How to comment:**
- Add genuine insight
- NOT: "Great point, Jeremy!"
- YES: Share your own experience/perspective

---

### Method 19: Use Other People's Audiences for Webinars

**What it is:** Offering to teach in someone else's community.

**Outreach:**
```
"Hey [Name], I run [business]. Would love to come 
into [their program] and teach [topic].

I can do a live training on [specific valuable thing].

Would that be interesting?"
```

---

### Method 20: Create Partnerships

**What it is:** Exchanging referrals with complementary businesses.

**Key:** Send referrals FIRST. Then ask for reciprocation.

---

## Category 5: Sales Optimization

### Method 21: Use Money-Back Guarantee

**What it is:** Removing risk from purchase decision.

**Why it's required for beginners:**
- No case studies = perceived high risk
- Guarantee = perceived zero risk
- Loss hurts more than gain feels good

**Rule:** Need either case studies OR guarantee. At least one.

---

### Method 22: Create ROI Calculator

**Story:** Top car salesman ever sent thank you notes monthly to every customer for 35 years.

**Why it works:** Frequency creates top-of-mind awareness.

---

## Category 6: Advanced Tactics

### Method 25: Create White Label Program

**What it is:** Letting clients resell your services under their name.

**How it works:**
- Client charges their client $X
- Client pays you $Y (less than X)
- Client keeps spread

**Benefits:**
- Zero acquisition cost
- Increases LTV of existing clients

---

### Method 26: Create Paid Trial Offers

**What it is:** One-time payment instead of recurring.

**Why it works:** People HATE subscriptions.

**Example:**
- Instead of: "$5K/month retainer"
- Offer: "$5K for 60 days, no auto-renew"

**After trial:** Ask if they want to continue.

---

### Method 27: Host Live Webinars

**What it is:** Monthly live training for your email list.

**Structure:**
1. Teach something valuable (45 min)
2. Make casual offer (5 min)
3. "If you want me to do this for you, $X"

**Frequency:** Monthly or every 6 weeks.

---

### Method 28: Ask for Email Responses

**What it is:** Getting people to reply to emails (not click links).

**Example:**
```
"I created a breakdown of [offer].

Reply 'send it' and I'll send you the Google Doc."
```

**Why:** Replies = identified interest = can follow up personally.

---

### Method 29: Screenshot Full Calendar

**What it is:** Posting proof of demand as social proof.

**Post:**
```
"All calls booked this week. If interested, 
reply and I'll put you on the waitlist."
```

**After week:** "Spots opened up. Book here: [link]"

---

### Method 30: Create Expensive Upsells

**What it is:** Offering something 5-10x more expensive than standard.

**Math:**
- 50 clients buy $5K offer = $250K
- 1 client buys $50K offer = +$50K
- Total = $300K (20% increase)

**Rule:** Only sell to existing buyers. No extra marketing needed.
