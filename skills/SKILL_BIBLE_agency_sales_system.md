# SKILL BIBLE: Complete Sales System (Better Than 99% of People)

## Executive Summary

What works for founders doesn't work for sales reps. Founders have 10+ years of experience, inherent authority, and reputation. Reps need a PROCESS they can plug into and see results fast, or they'll leave or blow calls. The goal: Make it easier to sell, not make them better at sales.

## The Three Qualities of Great Sales Reps

> From Bowtie Sales Guy

### 1. Empathy

**What it means:** Actually understand what prospects care about - they need to feel like you GET them

**How to build it:**
- Ask REAL questions, not generic crap
- Generic: "What are your 12-month goals?"
- Real: "What exactly are you trying to solve? What have you done about this in the past?"

**Result:** They feel heard → They trust you

### 2. Competence

> "Competence equals confidence"

**What it means:** Actually know what you're talking about

**How to build it:**
- 14-day paid onboarding period
- Treat it like training them to do the work
- Not just selling - understanding

**What happens when they're competent:**
- Objections easily handled
- Explanations make sense
- They come across as expert, not dope

### 3. Indifference

**What it means:** Not being needy (people smell neediness instantly)

**How to build it as owner:**
- Tons of leads (abundance)
- Great results (proof)
- The competence from training

**Result:** They are the prize, prospect needs them

### The Formula

```
Empathy = Trust
Competence = Confidence
Indifference = You Are The Prize
```

## The Congruence Principle

> "From the second they click the ad to the second they finish onboarding - everything is a straight line."

### The Journey Must Match

```
Ads/Content/Outreach → Landing Page → VSSL → Calendly → Pre-call Flow → First Part of Call → Onboarding
```

**Every step must say the same thing.**

**Why it matters:**
- When incongruent → Uneasy subconscious feeling → Derails process
- They clicked ad for message X → Why would landing page say Y?
- If they made it through, they're interested in what you're saying → Don't change it

---

## Phase 0A: Pre-Framing System

### Why Pre-Framing Matters

**Results:**
- Show rate goes up
- Quality goes up (they know what you're talking about)
- Price known ahead of time (no wasted calls)

### The Four Pre-Framing Tools

**1. Pre-Call Email Flow**
- Triggers when they book
- Multiple emails per day (more than you think)
- 4+ emails per day if call within 48 hours
- Content: Case studies, industry insights, FAQs, how it works, objection killing

**2. Retargeting Ads**
- Makes them more likely to show
- Opportunity for specific objection-handling ads
- Example: 9 retargeting ads
  - 3 case studies (different countries/niches)
  - 3 "why we're better" education ads
  - 3 industry insights

**3. YouTube Videos**
> "Perhaps the #1 thing you can do as founder to help your reps."

The 20-touch-point reality:
> "New research: 20 touchpoints over 4 different channels and 7 hours of time spent with you."

More time with you (even via video) = More trust = More likely to buy

**4. Content Cross-Posting**
- Create for Twitter
- Cross-post to LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram
- Repurpose to video (Reels, etc.)
- Algorithm serves your content to people who've visited site

## Phase 0B: Calendly Questions

### Why These Questions

**Benefits:**
- Better prepared for call
- More effort on form = More likely to show (loss aversion)
- Filters out non-serious

### The 8 Essential Questions

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Name | Basic |
| Email | Basic |
| Phone | Basic |
| Website | Research |
| Revenue (multiple choice) | Qualification + CRM sorting |
| Price confirmation ("Our offer costs $X-Y, are you okay with this?") | Filter out price objectors |
| Where did you learn about us? | Attribution + call approach |
| How long have you known about us? | Warmth gauge + timing |

**Why multiple choice for revenue:**
> "If short answer, they write 'zero', 'Zero', '$0', '0', 'nothing' - makes CRM sorting nightmare."

---

## Phase 0C: Pre-Call Research

> "90% of people don't do any pre-call research besides maybe read the Calendly form. That's crazy."

### Company Overview
- What company does
- Who is target audience/customers
- Key metrics (revenue, customers served)

### Team Members
- Who booked the call (founder? CMO? Assistant?)
- Other stakeholders (will they influence decision?)
- Org structure (30-person marketing team vs solo founder = different approach)

### Offer Positioning
- How you solve THEIR specific problem
- What makes your offer unique vs alternatives
- How offer aligns with their goals

### Social Proof
- Relevant case studies (similar niche)
- Relevant testimonials (similar size)
- Results that build credibility for THEM specifically

---

## Phase 1: Introduction

### The Problem

> "The person asking questions is the person in control. Newer reps get beta'd - prospect becomes alpha on call."

### The Introduction Script

```
1. Name + Company
2. Background (relevant to their problem)
3. Tenure (working with founder for X years)
4. Bridge question (tied to Calendly answers)
5. Frame the call
```

**Example:**
> "Hello, my name is Matt from 1000x Leads. I have a background in lead generation which is specific to what you're trying to do. I've been working closely with Leo for 12 years. I'd love to know - what resonated with you most about Leo's YouTube videos?"

**Then frame:**
> "The purpose of this call is to see if you qualify for our offer. Not everyone does. It's based on these factors: revenue, time, ambition, business type. Mind if I ask you a few questions to see how you compare to our most successful clients?"

They say yes → Now YOU control the call

---

## Phase 2: The Five Questions

> "Move the sale FORWARD, not sideways"

### Question 1: Why Are We Here Today?

**Purpose:** Understand why they're actually talking to you

**80% of time:** They tell you straight
**20% of time:** Surface-level BS - need to probe deeper

**Examples of real answers:**
- "Our lead flow has dried up and we need consistency"
- "We're looking for a more scalable solution - what we're doing isn't working"
- "Our ad spend isn't translating to ROI"

### Question 2: Why Interested in Solving For X?

**Purpose:** Understand their MOTIVATIONS

**Examples:**
- "Want to unlock potential of sales team - they don't have enough leads"
- "We have aggressive growth goals - just raised money"
- "We're first to market - don't want to waste the opportunity"

### Question 3: Why Is That A Problem?

**Purpose:** Understand the CONSEQUENCES

> "Motivations vs consequences - subtle but different"

**Examples:**
- "If we don't figure this out, we'll keep missing revenue targets - hurts long term"
- "Competitors are gaining traction and we're losing ground"
- "It's going to burn out our sales team - have to recruit more"
- "Investors are breathing down our neck"

### Question 4: Why Now?

**Purpose:** Discover if urgency exists

> "You cannot CREATE urgency. You can only DISCOVER if it exists."

**If now is NOT perfect time:** Ease up, stay in good graces
**If now IS perfect time:** Closing time, sales tactics time

**Examples:**
- "Just raised funding - time to invest before market saturates"
- "Board wants results this quarter"
- "Launching new product soon"
- "Finally figured out operations, now need leads"

### Question 5: Why Not Alternatives?

**Purpose:** Get them to admit why they need YOU

**Variations:**
- Why not do nothing?
- Why not do it yourself?
- Why not competitor X?
- Why not hire in-house?

**Examples:**
- "We've tried but don't have the expertise"
- "We tried, it hasn't worked"
- "Other agencies don't seem to deliver on promises"
- "Tried with X tool but it's too slow"

### Transition to Next Phase

> "Based on these answers, sounds like you're quite similar to our most successful clients. Mind if I show you a few slides with our offer and what we can do for you?"

---

## Phase 3: Screen Share Presentation

### Structure (5-7 minutes for 30-min call)

| Section | Purpose | Time |
|---------|---------|------|
| Intro/Highlight Reel | Credibility burst | 60 seconds |
| What We Do | Clear explanation | 1-2 slides |
| Why You Need It | Connect to their situation | 1-2 slides |
| How We Do It | Step-by-step, roadmap, timeline | 2-3 slides |
| Examples/Demo | Show don't tell | 1-2 slides |
| The Offer Summary | What they get | 1 slide |
| Price/Cost | Monthly, annual discounts | 1 slide |
| FAQs | Top 5-10 concerns | 2-3 slides |
| Next Steps | Excruciating detail | 1-2 slides |

### The FAQ Destroyer Principle

> "Instead of overcoming objections, PREVENT them."

**If you don't address FAQs, they think:**
1. You're sneaky/hiding something → Don't trust you
2. You're stupid and don't know concerns exist

**Neither is good.**

### Next Steps Section

> "Excruciating detail about what happens between payment and launch"

- Within 5 minutes → Follow-up email with X, Y, Z
- Day 1 → This happens
- Day 2-3 → This happens
- Week 1 → First deliverable
- Week 2 → Etc.
