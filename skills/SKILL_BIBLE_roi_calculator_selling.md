# SKILL BIBLE: ROI Calculator - Selling with Pure Logic (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents how to use pure logic and math to close more sales calls. The core insight: if you're a B2B service company, your clients are buying PROFIT, not your service. If the math doesn't work for them to profit, they won't buy—no amount of sales skill changes this. The solution: qualify properly and only pitch prospects where the ROI is undeniable.

**Key Quote:** "The way I want you to get from this is not to charge less money—it's to sell to larger people."

## Section 1: The Fundamental Truth

### What B2B Clients Actually Buy

**You think they buy:** Your service (email marketing, lead gen, etc.)

**They actually buy:** Profit

```
Client's Goal = Make more money than they spend on you
```

If this math doesn't work, they will NOT buy. Period.

## Section 2: Example 1 - Email Marketing Agency

### The Scenario

You're an e-commerce email marketing agency. You send emails for e-commerce brands to make them more sales.

**Your price:** $3,000/month

### Prospect 1: IT WORKS

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| List size | 30,000 |
| Product profit margin | 40% |
| Additional sales you generate | $32,000/month |
| Their profit from additional sales | $12,800 (40% of $32K) |
| They pay you | $3,000 |
| Their net profit | $9,800 |
| ROI | 4.3x |

**Result:** This makes logical sense. They'll buy.

### Prospect 2: IT DOESN'T WORK

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| List size | 5,000 |
| Product profit margin | 30% |
| Additional sales you generate | $5,500/month |
| Their profit from additional sales | $1,650 (30% of $5.5K) |
| They pay you | $3,000 |
| Their net profit | -$1,350 |
| ROI | 0.55x (negative) |

**Result:** They LOSE money. This doesn't make sense. They won't buy.

## Section 3: Example 2 - Lead Generation Agency

### The Scenario

You're a lead gen agency. You send cold emails on behalf of businesses to get them sales calls.

**Your price:** $400/call

### Prospect 1: LOW LTV

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Service price | $300/month |
| Average retention | 6 months |
| LTV | $1,800 |
| Close rate | 20% |
| Calls to make 1 sale | 5 |
| Cost of 5 calls | $2,000 |
| They pay you | $2,000 |
| They make | $1,800 |
| Net | -$200 |

**Result:** They LOSE money. Won't buy.

### Prospect 2: HIGH LTV

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Service price | $8,000/month |
| Average retention | 6 months |
| LTV | $48,000 |
| Close rate | 20% |
| Calls to make 1 sale | 5 |
| Cost of 5 calls | $2,000 |
| They pay you | $2,000 |
| They make | $48,000 |
| Net profit | $46,000 |
| ROI | 24x |

**Result:** This is a no-brainer. They'll absolutely buy.

## Section 4: The Only Two Options

When the math doesn't work, you have exactly two choices:

### Option 1: Lower Your Prices ❌

**Not recommended because:**
- Race to the bottom
- Destroys margins
- Attracts worse clients
- Doesn't solve underlying issue

### Option 2: Sell to Larger Businesses ✅

**Recommended because:**
- Same effort, bigger result
- Math naturally works
- Better clients
- Higher LTV yourself

---

## Section 5: The Consultative Approach

### Why You Can't Close

"The reason you probably can't close a lot of your calls is because you're getting on the phone with people who it would not logically make sense for."

### The ROI Calculator Method

**On the sales call:**
1. Screen share a Google Doc
2. Walk through the numbers together
3. Use conservative values
4. Show them it's mathematically certain
5. Demonstrate your confidence
6. Offer a guarantee

### The Opening Script

```
"Thanks for getting on the phone with me, [Name].

You're running a business and the purpose of that is 
probably to make a profit.

So if it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you a couple 
questions to see if this would financially work for 
both of us.

If I'm confident in being able to give you an offer—
and possibly a guarantee if I'm super confident in results."
```

### Qualifying Questions

1. "What kind of business are you running?"
2. "Is it B2B or B2C?"
3. "Who are you targeting?"
4. "Is that targetable through [your method]?"
5. "How much do you charge?"
6. "What's your average client retention?"

**Calculate live:** "So based on these numbers, we'd need to get you [X] clients to be profitable..."

---

## Section 6: The Math Framework

### For Any Service

```
Client's ROI = (Value You Generate × Their Profit Margin) / Your Price

If ROI > 1 → Good prospect
If ROI < 1 → Bad prospect
```

### Target Ratios

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| <1x | They lose money. Don't sell. |
| 1-2x | Marginal. Risky for both. |
| 3-5x | Good. Reasonable value. |
| 5-10x | Excellent. Easy close. |
| 10x+ | No-brainer. Will close fast. |

### Minimum Viable Client Size

**Calculate backwards:**
1. What's your price?
2. What ROI ratio do you need? (aim for 5x minimum)
3. What results can you realistically generate?
4. What client size makes the math work?

**Only prospect clients above that threshold.**

## Section 7: Pre-Call Qualification

### Before You Ever Get on the Phone

**Research:**
- Company revenue (if visible)
- Price points they charge
- Number of customers/clients
- Existing marketing presence

**Calculate:**
- Estimated LTV of their customers
- Your potential impact
- Whether math COULD work

**If math can't work:** Don't take the call.

### On Application Forms

**Ask questions that reveal:**
- Monthly revenue
- Average customer value
- Current client count
- Marketing budget

**Filter out** those where math obviously fails.

---

## Section 8: The Demonstration Close

### The Power Move

Instead of just TELLING them about ROI, SHOW them.

**Process:**
1. Open Google Doc or spreadsheet
2. Input THEIR numbers
3. Calculate together in real-time
4. Use their conservative estimates
5. Show the undeniable math
6. Present the guarantee

### Why This Works

- Removes skepticism (it's THEIR numbers)
- Creates certainty
- Demonstrates competence
- Makes decision logical, not emotional
- Objections become mathematical discussions

---

## Section 9: Handling When Math Doesn't Work

### Be Honest

"Based on what you've told me, the math doesn't quite work at your current scale. Here's what would need to change for this to make sense..."

### Alternative Paths

1. **Smaller engagement:** Lower price, prove value, scale later
2. **Future timing:** "Come back when you're at [size]"
3. **Different offer:** Maybe consulting vs. done-for-you
4. **Referral:** "Let me connect you with someone better suited"
