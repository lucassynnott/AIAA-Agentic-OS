## Executive Summary

The secret to scaling an agency rapidly isn't just client acquisition - it's reducing customer acquisition cost (CAC) to zero while building systems that compound. This skill bible covers the five key systems that enabled $0 to $900K/month growth in 11 months.

---

## The Context

**Business:** Landing page and CRO agency for e-commerce stores
**Timing:** Right after iOS 14 tanked ad performance (perfect storm)
**Key Insight:** Many have copied the offers and funnels, none have matched the results because they don't have the backend systems.

---

## System 1: Partnership Strategy

### The Core Question

> "Who sells to the same customers as me, but is not selling a competing service?"

### Types of Partnerships

**For E-commerce Agency (Example):**
- Facebook Ads agencies
- Google Ads agencies
- SEO agencies
- Email marketing agencies
- Influencer marketing agencies
- UGC agencies
- TikTok Shop agencies

### Partnership Depth

**Have 3 options per service at different price points:**
- US-based option (premium)
- Eastern Europe-based option (mid)
- Philippines-based option (budget)

### The Three Elements of Great Partnership Pitches

Most people only do #1. You need all three:

**1. Referral Fee/Incentive** (Everyone has this)
- Standard, not special
- Pay within 1 hour of closing (dopamine feedback loop)
- Never make it tedious

**2. How This Helps Their LTV or CAC**
- "Your ads will actually convert"
- "Clients will churn less"
- Shows you understand THEIR business

**3. Special Offer That Eliminates Risk**
- "Free above-the-fold mockup for all your clients"
- Pretend you work for them (white label)
- Remove all friction from saying yes

### Referral Partnership Results

**At Peak:**
- 40 referral calls booked per week
- 50%+ close rate
- ~20 new clients per week from referrals alone

### White Label Partnership Results

**The Offer:**
> "Pay me $5,000/month and I will make unlimited landing pages for your clients (max 2 at a time = 4-8 per month)"

**How to Sell It:**
- "This will improve your LTV because ads will actually convert"
- "Clients will churn less"
- "I'll do free above-the-fold mockup and offer plan for all your clients while pretending I work for you"

**Results:**
- 77 paid ad agencies paying $5K/month
- $385K/month in recurring revenue
- Very low churn (locked in)
- 5-10x easier to close than direct clients

**Why Easier:**
- E-commerce stores get massive outreach
- E-commerce agencies get far less
- Higher response rates
- More likely to stick

---

## System 2: Cold Email Dominance

### Why E-commerce is Hardest

1. **Volume of emails they receive** - Inactive Shopify stores get 30+ emails/week
2. **Easy to find** - Data tools + "uses Shopify" = perfect list
3. **So many stores need so many services** - Huge demand creates huge supply

### The Game-Changer: Instant Calling

> "The number one difference maker in cold email is you have to call them right away."

**System:**
- Response comes in → Notification to Google Sheet
- Sheet flashes → Appointment setter calls immediately
- Text message (with first name so not "likely spam")
- Double call (gets through weaker do-not-disturb)

**Result:** 2-5x results for same effort

### 24/7 Coverage System

**Structure:**
- 3 appointment setters in Mexico/South America
- 3 in South Africa/Eastern Europe
- 3 in Indonesia/Malaysia/Philippines

**Total:** 9 setters minimum, 3 always online in 8-hour shifts

**Why 3 per shift:**
1. Handle volume
2. Redundancy (appointment setters are unreliable)

### Results

- 100 calls booked per week from cold email
- CAC through cold email: $680 (vs $1,988 from paid ads)

---

## System 3: Zero CAC Engine

### The Philosophy

From Jay Abraham's "Getting Everything You Can Out of All You've Got":
> "You want your customer acquisition cost to go to zero and your LTV to go to infinite."

### The Numbers

| Channel | CAC |
|---------|-----|
| Paid Ads (Book a Call) | $1,988 |
| Cold Email | $680 |
| Outbound Setters (DMs) | $575 |
| **Blended Average** | **$1,077** |

**Intro Offer:** $3,300 at 80% gross margin = $2,640 available for CAC

### The Onboarding Referral System

**In onboarding document and call, include form:**

"Do you need...?"
- Facebook ads agency
- Google ads agency
- TikTok ads agency
- Influencer marketing agency
- SEO agency
- Email marketing agency
- Accountant
- Bookkeeper
- Lawyer
- Retail broker/agent
- Tracking/attribution software
- Agency ad accounts
- AB testing tools

**10-15 referral options in onboarding**

### The Fee Structure

**Standard:** 10% recurring commission
**What Matthew negotiated:** 100% of first month retainer

**Example:**
- Agency charges $5K/month
- Standard: $500/month forever
- Negotiated: $5K upfront, nothing after

**Average payout:** $3,500 per successful referral

### The Math

- CAC: $1,077
- Average referral fee: $3,500
- **One successful referral eliminates CAC for 3+ customers**

**Real examples:**
- Some clients converted 5-10 referrals
- One client generated $15K+ in referral fees alone

### Result

> "This process was so successful that it completely eliminated my customer acquisition cost."

## System 4: Low-Ticket Funnel

### The Offer

**Evolution:**
- Started: 3 templates for $17
- Evolved: 100 landing page templates for $97
- Tested: 1,000 templates for $97 (no better than 100)

### The Strategy

1. Run ads to e-commerce stores
2. Sell templates for $97
3. Break even on ad spend
4. Upsell to done-for-you ($3,300) over time

### Key Metric

**2.1% of template buyers upsold to done-for-you package**

**Math:**
- Template price: $97
- Upsell rate: 2.1%
- Upsell value: $3,300
- Additional value per customer: $3,300 x 2.1% = $69.30
- **Breakeven CAC:** $97 + $69.30 = ~$166

### Peak Performance

- $7K/day in ad spend
- 60-100 purchasers per day
- 2.1% conversion to $3,300 package
- Referral fees STILL applied on template buyers

### Hidden Revenue

- Templates built on WebFlow (uncommon platform)
- Most buyers didn't have WebFlow
- Affiliate link in templates
- Thousands of signups → Recurring affiliate revenue → Poured back into ads

### Lifespan

- Worked for ~7 months
- Cost per purchase increased over time
- Shut down at ~$110 CAC (no longer breaking even)

## System 5: Factory Fulfillment

### The Problem

How do you fulfill 200+ new clients per month?

### The Solution

> "Assembly line approach to making landing pages"

### The Template System

**3 "Elite Templates" for each page type:**
1. Sales pages
2. Advertorials
3. Listicles

**Hyper-optimized from:**
- AB test learnings
- Continuous improvement
- Client results data

**The Secret:**
> "Once you put people's colors, logos, pictures, and branding on each page, you would never be able to tell they were templates unless specifically looking."

### The Team Structure

**Layer 1: Production (Pakistan/India) - 60 people**
- Use pre-made AI copywriting prompts
- Take assets from onboarding form
- Develop offer using "AI version of Matt"
- Create page with all assets and copy
- Delivery: Within 24 hours to Layer 2

**Layer 2: Editing (US/Canada) - 15 people**
- Act like newspaper editors
- Take from 80-90% to 95-98%
- Ensure looks good, functional, no mistakes
- Pass to Layer 3

**Layer 3: QA (Philippines) - 5 people**
- Go through checklist
- Ensure actually perfect
- Pass to account manager

**Layer 4: Account Manager**
- Present to client
- Get yay/nay
- Handle revisions
- Launch

### Timeline

- First draft to client: 48-72 business hours
- Revisions: 1-2 days
- Live: Less than 7 business days total

### Results

- 55% of landing pages beat original in AB test
- Most clients already had optimized pages (hard to beat)
- 200+ clients/month handled
- Most clients happy

### Key Lesson

> "Get a very good COO. I paid mine about 50,000 pounds per month and he basically saved my life."

### Who to Avoid

- People very focused on branding
- "We need it to be exactly like this" people
- Train closers to discourage them from buying
