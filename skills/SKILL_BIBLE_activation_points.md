# SKILL BIBLE: Activation Points (90x Conversion Multiplier)

## Executive Summary

Activation points are milestones or key objectives that, when completed, make someone dramatically more likely to buy. This concept has generated $500 million in sales from a single funnel. When implemented correctly, expect 90x improvement in conversion, not 10-20%.

## The Problem Activation Points Solve

### Problem 1: Hard-to-Sell Services

**Categories:**
1. **Consulting/Coaching/Info offers**
   - Cold traffic doesn't know you
   - Don't understand your philosophy
   - No trust or relationship

2. **Done-for-you services requiring client involvement**
   - Example: YouTube agency
   - You do scripts, editing, thumbnails
   - But client still has to film
   - Gap between "interested" and "able to be client" is massive

### Problem 2: Maxed Out TAM (Total Addressable Market)

At $500K-$1M+/month ad spend, some markets get maxed out.

**Activation points CREATE demand instead of just capturing it.**

---

## The River Metaphor

```
[Current State] ~~~~~ RIVER (Gap) ~~~~~ [Your Service]

The river is:
- Too wide to jump
- Current too strong
- Most people can't cross

With Activation Points:
[Current State] → AP1 → AP2 → AP3 → AP4 → AP5 → [Your Service]

Each activation point = stepping stone
Makes crossing manageable
```

## Case Study 1: Matthew's Consulting Business

### The Problem
- Sells consulting to agency owners
- Very difficult to sell to cold audiences
- They don't know the philosophy
- Long sales cycle (3-6 months from YouTube viewer to client)

### The Five Activation Points

| # | Activation Point | What It Is |
|---|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Work Form System | Hourly accountability form |
| 2 | Project Management System | Task management setup |
| 3 | CRM Build | Customer relationship system |
| 4 | Metrics Tracking | Dashboard with all numbers |
| 5 | Operations Spreadsheet | Team planning tool |

### The Result

> "If someone has these five things in their hand and they're using them before they ever get on a call with me, they are 90 times more likely to convert."

**90x improvement** - Not 10%, not 20%, but 9,000% more likely to buy.

### The Shift in Thinking

**Before:** "How do I get more clients?"
**After:** "How do I get more people to download/access AND implement my activation points?"

## Case Study 2: YouTube Agency

### The Problem
- Massive gap between "interested in YouTube" and "ready to hire agency"
- Client still has to film (can't do it all for them)
- Target market = only people already comfortable on camera

### The Five Activation Points

| # | Activation Point | Purpose |
|---|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | Gear/Production Setup | Camera, lights, microphone for their budget |
| 2 | Idea Generation System | How to come up with video ideas |
| 3 | Camera Confidence | 30-day speaking practice challenge |
| 4 | YouTube Metrics Guide | What to track and measure |
| 5 | YouTube Improvement Sheet | Realistic plan to improve |

### The Result

**Creates demand instead of capturing it:**
- Before: Only sell to people already filming
- After: Take complete beginners → Make them filmable → Now they're qualified

**TAM expansion:** Building your own market of qualified buyers

## Case Study 3: $500 Million Affiliate Funnel

### The Context
- Affiliate/biz-op offer
- $15K course
- 90-120 minute webinar funnel
- Doing $2-3M/month

### The Problem
- Show rate: Fine
- Close rate: Fine
- Economics: Fine
- **Bottleneck:** People not taking action after webinar

### The Discovery

Analyzed all data:
- Call calendar
- Onboarding forms
- Form responses

**Found ONE activation point that predicted conversion:**

> "The number one thing that determines whether someone moves forward: If they buy their domain name right after the webinar."

### The Offer

```
"In 24 hours after the webinar, if you send us a screenshot of your 
GoDaddy/Namecheap/Google Domain purchase, we will send you $25 to cover the cost."
```

### The Result

```
Before: $2-3M/month
After: $20-30M/month (almost overnight)
```

**Hockey stick growth from ONE activation point.**

## How to Find Your Activation Points

### Step 1: Analyze Data (Looking Back)

> "It's way easier to implement good activation points looking back and connecting the dots as opposed to just guessing."

**Data Sources:**
- Onboarding form responses
- Calendly book information
- Email flow engagement
- What clients had in common when they bought

**Recommended:** Several hundred thousand dollars/month before enough data

### Step 2: Brainstorm 10 Potential Activation Points

Ask: "What must be true for someone to buy from me?"

**Categories to consider:**
- Skills they need
- Tools they need
- Beliefs they need
- Actions they need to take
- Results they need to see

### Step 3: Create 5 Activation Points

For each, create:
- Landing page
- Email flow
- Deliverable (template, tool, guide)
- Connection to next activation point

### Step 4: Create Interconnected Web

**Critical:** Each activation point leads to the next

```
AP1 → AP2 → AP3 → AP4 → AP5
 ↑_____|_____|_____|_____|
 |_____|_____|_____|_____|
 (all cross-promote each other)
```

**NOT separate campaigns.** One interconnected system.

### Step 5: Distribute Everywhere

- Newsletter
- Email flows
- Community
- Retargeting ads for each
- Content promoting each

## Implementation Framework

### The Goal

Get people to:
1. **Access** activation points
2. **Implement** activation points

Both are required. Download without implementation doesn't work.

### The Key Insight

> "They don't need to complete ALL activation points to buy. Some people are comfortable jumping at 40% across. Some at halfway. Plan for all five, but many will convert earlier."

### Measuring Activation Points

**Compare:**
- People who completed 0 APs → Conversion rate
- People who completed 1 AP → Conversion rate
- People who completed 2 APs → Conversion rate
- etc.

**Find the inflection point:** Where does conversion jump dramatically?

## The Math of Activation Points

### Without Activation Points
- 1,000 leads
- 3% book calls (30 calls)
- 20% close (6 clients)

### With Activation Points
- 1,000 leads
- Get 200 to complete AP1
- Get 100 to complete AP2
- Get 50 to complete AP3
- 50 people now 90x more likely to buy
- Even at 20% close = 10 clients
- But they convert at 50%+ = 25+ clients

**4x+ improvement from same traffic.**
