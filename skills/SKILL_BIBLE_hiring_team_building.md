## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You can't scale past a certain point alone. The leverage of other people's time is how agencies grow from $20K to $200K/month and beyond.

**The Hiring Truth**: Getting rich through other people is the only path to real scale. You trade money for time and leverage.

**The Agency Scaling Path**:
```
Solo ($0-$20K) → First Hire ($20K-$50K) → Team ($50K-$200K) → Organization ($200K+)
```

**Key Metrics**:
- First hire: Usually at $15-25K/month revenue
- Cost ratio: Employee should generate 3-5x their cost
- Onboarding time: 2-4 weeks to productivity
- Management ratio: 5-7 direct reports max per manager
