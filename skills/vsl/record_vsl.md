## Overview

### What is a VSL?

A Video Sales Letter (VSL) is a conversion-focused video that presents your service offering, establishes credibility, and drives prospects to book a call or take action. Unlike casual content, a VSL is a strategic sales asset designed to work 24/7 on your landing page.

### Why OBS Over Loom or Screen Recorders?

**Professional Quality**: OBS provides broadcast-quality output that separates you from competitors using basic screen recording tools.

**Customization**: Full control over layout, composition, sources, and quality settings.

**Credibility**: Professional presentation signals expertise and builds trust with high-value B2B prospects.

**Standing Out**: When everyone uses Loom, OBS-recorded VSLs immediately differentiate your offer.

### Recording Philosophy

**Quality Over Speed**: A well-produced VSL converts significantly better than a rushed one. Invest 60% of your time in research and setup, 40% in execution.

**Authenticity Matters**: While quality is important, authentic delivery trumps perfect production. Be yourself, show your face, be human.

**Test and Iterate**: Your first VSL won't be perfect. Record, test, gather data, and improve.

- Can look "amateurish" for high-ticket offers

### External Camera Setup (Sony ZV-E10, Canon, etc.)

#### Hardware Connection

**Step 1: Connect Camera**

Option A: USB Connection (if camera supports USB video)
1. Connect camera to computer via USB
2. Enable "USB Streaming" in camera menu
3. Camera appears as webcam device

Option B: HDMI Capture Card
1. Connect camera HDMI output to capture card (Elgato Cam Link, etc.)
2. Connect capture card to computer USB port
3. Camera appears as video capture device

**Step 2: Camera Settings**

**On Camera**:
- Set to Manual video mode (M mode)
- Shutter speed: 1/60 (for 30fps video)
- Aperture: f/2.8-f/4 (shallow depth of field)
- ISO: Auto or 400-800 (depending on lighting)
- White Balance: Auto or 5000K (match your lighting)
- Focus: Manual (set focus on your eyes and lock)
- Clean HDMI: Enable (removes overlays)
- Display: Turn off screen during recording

**Step 3: Add to OBS**

2. Hold Option/Alt + drag to crop
3. Position on left or right side (typically right side)
4. Ensure eye-line is in upper third of frame

#### Camera Positioning Guidelines

**Horizontal Placement**:
- Right side of frame: Most common, leaves left for slides
- Left side of frame: Alternative, slides go right
- Don't center yourself (slides need space)

**Vertical Framing**:
- Eyes in upper 1/3 of frame
- Top of head has slight space (not cut off)
- Bottom cuts around mid-chest

**Distance from Camera**:
- 2-3 feet away for ideal depth of field
- Close enough to feel personal
- Far enough to not dominate frame

**Eye Line**:
- Look directly at camera lens
- If reading script, position near camera
- Natural eye contact builds trust

### Camera Comparison: Built-in vs External

**Visual Quality Comparison**

Built-In FaceTime Camera:
- Resolution: 720p
- Depth of Field: Everything in focus
- Color: Tends toward cooler tones
- Low Light: Noisy/grainy
- Overall: "Acceptable" but not impressive

External (Sony ZV-E10):
- Resolution: 1080p
- Depth of Field: Background blur (professional look)
- Color: Rich, accurate skin tones
- Low Light: Clean, minimal noise
- Overall: "Professional" and high-value

**Decision Framework**

Use Built-In If:
- Testing your first VSL
- Budget is very tight
- Service is lower ticket (<$3k)
- Targeting less sophisticated buyers

Use External If:
- Selling high-ticket ($5k+) services
- Targeting enterprise/sophisticated buyers
- Positioning as premium provider
- Long-term VSL asset

**Pro Tip**: Start with built-in, test conversion rate, then upgrade to external camera and measure lift. Data-driven decision making.

## Audio Configuration

### Built-In Microphone Setup

**Step 1: Add Audio Source**

By default, OBS includes "Mic/Aux" audio from your computer's built-in microphone. If not:
1. Sources → + → Audio Input Capture
2. Name: "Microphone"
3. Device: Built-in Microphone
4. Click OK

**Step 2: Audio Levels**

In Audio Mixer:
- Speak at normal recording volume
- Levels should peak around -12dB to -6dB (yellow zone)
- Never reach red (0dB) = distortion
- If too quiet: Increase system mic input level
- If too loud: Decrease system mic input level

**Step 3: Noise Suppression**

Built-in mics pick up room noise. Apply filters:
1. Right-click audio source in mixer
2. Filters → + → Noise Suppression
3. Method: Speex (default)
4. Suppression Level: -30dB

**Built-In Mic Limitations**:
- Picks up keyboard noise
- Echo/reverb in untreated rooms
- Less warm/rich tone
- Overall "consumer" sound quality

### External Microphone Setup (Shure SM7B, Rode PodMic, etc.)

#### Hardware Connection

**Required Equipment**:
- Microphone (Shure SM7B, Audio-Technica AT2020, Rode PodMic)
- Audio Interface (Focusrite Scarlett Solo/2i2)
- XLR Cable (mic to interface)
- USB Cable (interface to computer)
- Optional: Cloudlifter (for gain boost with SM7B)
- Optional: Mic arm/boom stand

**Step 1: Connect Hardware**
1. Connect XLR cable from mic to interface input 1
2. Connect USB cable from interface to computer
3. Turn on phantom power (48V) if using condenser mic (AT2020)
4. Do NOT use phantom power with SM7B or PodMic (dynamic mics)
5. Position mic 4-6 inches from mouth

**Step 2: Interface Settings**
- Gain knob: Start at 12 o'clock position
- Monitor: Off (to avoid echo)
- Direct Monitor: Off

**Step 3: Add to OBS**
1. Sources → + → Audio Input Capture
2. Name: "Audio Input Capture"
3. Device: "Scarlett Solo USB" (or your interface)
4. Click OK

**Step 4: Set to Mono**

Critical: Audio interfaces output in stereo, but you're recording single mic in mono. If you don't fix this, audio will only come out of left channel.

1. Right-click audio source in mixer
2. Advanced Audio Properties
3. Channels: Mono
4. Click Close

**Step 5: Remove Built-In Mic**

Your computer's built-in mic (Mic/Aux) will still be active:
1. In Audio Mixer, find "Mic/Aux"
2. Click on the volume slider
3. Drag all the way down to -∞ dB
4. Muted permanently

**Step 6: Optimize Levels**
- Speak at your recording volume
- Adjust interface gain until levels peak -12dB to -6dB
- Test recording and listen back
- Adjust gain accordingly

#### Audio Filter Chain (Advanced)

Professional audio requires processing:

**Filter 1: Noise Suppression**

2. + → Noise Suppression
3. Method: RNNoise
4. Suppression Level: -30dB to -40dB

**Filter 2: Noise Gate**
1. + → Noise Gate
2. Close Threshold: -40dB (when to close gate)
3. Open Threshold: -35dB (when to open gate)
4. Attack Time: 25ms
5. Hold Time: 200ms
6. Release Time: 150ms

Purpose: Cuts mic when you're not speaking, eliminating room noise

**Filter 3: Compressor**
1. + → Compressor
2. Ratio: 3:1
3. Threshold: -20dB
4. Attack: 6ms
5. Release: 60ms
6. Output Gain: +4dB
7. Sidechain/Ducking: None

Purpose: Evens out volume, makes quiet parts louder and loud parts quieter

**Filter 4: EQ (Optional)**
1. + → VST 2.x Plugin → Choose EQ plugin
2. Or use 3-band EQ:
   - High-pass filter at 80Hz (remove rumble)
   - Slight boost at 3-5kHz (presence)
   - Slight cut at 200-400Hz if muddy

**Filter 5: Limiter**
1. + → Limiter
2. Threshold: -6dB
3. Release: 60ms

Purpose: Safety net to prevent any peaks from distorting

#### Microphone Comparison

### Monitoring Audio During Recording

**Headphone Monitoring**:
- Plug headphones into audio interface (if available)
- Or use OBS's "Monitor Off" setting to hear yourself
- Listen for:
  - Plosives (P and B sounds popping)
  - Sibilance (harsh S sounds)
  - Background noise (AC, traffic, computer fan)
  - Mouth clicks (stay hydrated)

**Audio Levels to Watch**:
- Consistent: Levels shouldn't wildly fluctuate
- Healthy: Averaging -18dB to -12dB
- No Clipping: Never hitting red/0dB

## Scene Composition

### Understanding Layers

In OBS, sources stack from bottom to top:
- Bottom source = Back layer
- Top source = Front layer
- Front layers cover back layers

For VSL, typical layer order (bottom to top):
1. Color Source (background)
2. Display/Window Capture (slides)
3. Video Capture (camera)
4. Text overlays (if any)

### Standard VSL Layout

**Layout Option 1: Camera Right, Slides Left (Recommended)**

```
+-------------------+-------------------+
|                   |                   |
|                   |     CAMERA        |
|     SLIDES        |                   |
|                   |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+
     (60% width)         (40% width)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Western reading pattern (left to right)
- Slides get primary attention
- Camera provides secondary human connection
- Feels natural and balanced

**Layout Option 2: Camera Left, Slides Right**

```
+-------------------+-------------------+
|                   |                   |
|     CAMERA        |                   |
|                   |     SLIDES        |
|                   |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+
     (40% width)         (60% width)
```

**When to Use**:
- Personal preference
- If you have elements on right side of slides
- Testing different layouts

**Layout Option 3: Picture-in-Picture**

```
+----------------------------------+
|                                  |
|          SLIDES                  |
|                          +-----+ |
|                          |     | |
|                          | CAM | |
|                          +-----+ |
+----------------------------------+
```

**When to Use**:
- Slides need full width
- Camera is secondary
- More traditional webinar feel

**Not Recommended for VSL**: Feels less personal, camera is too small

2. Open in Preview/Paint
3. Use eyedropper to get exact hex color

**Step 2: Apply to Background**
1. Click Background source
2. Properties → Select Color
3. Enter hex color code
4. Click OK

Now background perfectly matches slides = seamless look

#### Matching Slide Background to Camera Side

If camera has white wall behind you, make background white. If dark wall, consider dark background with light text on slides.

#### Adding Subtle Borders (Optional)

To separate camera from slides:

**Step 1: Add Color Source**
1. Sources → + → Color Source
2. Name: "Border"
3. Color: Dark gray or brand color
4. Click OK

**Step 2: Make it Thin Line**
1. Resize to narrow vertical strip (3-5 pixels wide)
2. Position between camera and slides
3. Creates visual separation

**When to Use**: If camera background and slide background are too similar in color

### Testing Your Composition

**Step 1: Start Test Recording**
1. Click "Start Recording" in Controls
2. Advance through some slides
3. Speak for 30-60 seconds
4. Click "Stop Recording"

## Lighting and Environment

### Why Lighting Matters

**First Impressions**: Good lighting makes you look professional, trustworthy, and credible.

**Bad Lighting Red Flags**:
- Dark, shadowy face: Looks untrustworthy
- Overexposed/blown out: Looks amateurish
- Yellow/orange tint: Looks cheap
- Harsh shadows: Looks unflattering

**Good Lighting Benefits**:
- Clear, well-lit face: Builds trust
- Even skin tones: Looks professional
- Proper color: Looks like a real business
- Flattering appearance: Increases watch time

### Natural Light Setup (Free)

**Window Lighting**:
1. Position yourself facing a window
2. Window should be in front of you (not behind)
3. Indirect sunlight is best (not direct harsh sun)
4. Record during daytime (10am-2pm for consistent light)
5. Close distance to window (3-6 feet away)

**Pros**:
- Free
- Soft, flattering light
- Natural look

**Cons**:
- Time-dependent (must record during day)
- Weather-dependent (cloudy days look different)
- Inconsistent if recording multiple takes

### Artificial Lighting Setup (Recommended)

**Why Invest in Lights**:
- Record any time of day
- Consistent across multiple recording sessions
- Complete control over look
- More professional appearance

#### Budget Lighting ($50-100)

**Equipment**:
- 2x Ring lights or LED panels ($25-50 each)
- Desk stands or tripods

**Setup**:
1. Key Light: Main light on one side (left or right) at 45° angle
2. Fill Light: Secondary light on opposite side at lower intensity
3. Both lights at eye level or slightly above
4. Distance: 3-4 feet from you

**Settings**:
- Color Temperature: 5000K-5600K (daylight)
- Brightness: Adjust until evenly lit
- No harsh shadows on face

#### Professional Lighting ($200-400)

**Equipment**:
- Elgato Key Light or Neewer 660 LED Panel
- Softbox or umbrella diffuser
- Light stands
- Optional: Hair light (backlight)

**Three-Point Lighting Setup**:

**1. Key Light** (Primary):
- Strongest light
- Position at 45° to left or right of camera
- Eye level or slightly above
- Creates main illumination

**2. Fill Light** (Secondary):
- Softer than key light (50-75% intensity)
- Position opposite side of key light
- Fills in shadows created by key
- Evens out illumination

**3. Hair/Rim Light** (Accent):
- Behind you, pointing at back of head/shoulders
- Separates you from background
- Adds depth and dimension
- Optional but looks great

**Settings**:
- All lights: 5000K-5600K color temperature
- Key: 100% brightness
- Fill: 50-75% brightness
- Hair: 25-50% brightness
- Adjust based on your skin tone and preference

### Color Temperature Explained

**Kelvin Scale**:
- 2700K: Warm orange (tungsten bulbs)
- 3200K: Warm yellow (indoor lighting)
- 5000K-5600K: Neutral daylight ← **Recommended**
- 6500K+: Cool blue (overcast day)

**Why 5000-5600K for VSL**:
- Looks natural
- Matches most indoor environments
- Accurate skin tones
- Professional standard

**Mixing Color Temperatures** = BAD:
- Don't mix warm and cool lights
- Causes strange skin tones
- Looks unprofessional
- All lights should match

### Camera Settings for Lighting

**Auto vs Manual**:
- Auto White Balance: Usually works fine
- Auto ISO: Acceptable if well-lit
- Auto Exposure: Can work but may fluctuate

**Manual Control (Advanced)**:
- White Balance: 5000K
- ISO: 400-800 (lower = cleaner image)
- Shutter Speed: 1/60 (for 30fps)
- Aperture: f/2.8-f/4 (shallow depth, blurred background)

### Background Considerations

**What's Behind You**:
- Avoid: Messy room, unmade bed, clutter
- Good: Clean wall, bookshelf, plants, subtle decor
- Best: Neutral, non-distracting background

**Background Distance**:
- Sit 3-6 feet away from background
- Creates depth and separation
- Enables background blur (with good camera)

**Colors**:
- Avoid bright colors that distract
- Neutral tones work best (gray, beige, white)
- Can match brand colors subtly

### Room Acoustics (Bonus)

**Echo/Reverb**:
- Empty rooms = lots of echo
- Add: Rugs, curtains, furniture, acoustic panels
- Reduces echo = cleaner audio

**Background Noise**:
- Turn off: AC, fans, appliances during recording
- Close windows (traffic noise)
- Inform housemates you're recording
- Use "Do Not Disturb" signs

### Pre-Recording Environment Checklist

Before hitting record:
- [ ] Lighting turned on and warmed up (LED lights instant, tungsten need time)

- [ ] Smile (sets positive tone)

### Starting the Recording

**Step 1: Final OBS Check**
- Preview window looks good
- Audio levels peaking -12 to -6 dB
- Camera in focus
- Slides in present mode
- All sources visible

**Step 2: Start Recording**
- Click "Start Recording" or hit hotkey (Spacebar)
- OBS shows red dot = recording active
- Timer counts up

**Step 3: Slate (Optional but Recommended)**
Before starting your actual VSL:
- "This is take 1 for [Service Name] VSL, recorded [date]"
- Clap hands once (for audio sync if needed)
- Pause 3 seconds

**Step 4: Begin Your VSL**
- Look at camera
- Smile
- Start with your hook from script
- Speak naturally
- Use slides as prompts (don't read directly)

### During Recording

#### Energy and Delivery

**Voice Energy**:
- Speak 10-20% more energetically than conversation
- Camera saps energy, compensate
- Vary pitch and tone (not monotone)
- Emphasize key points

**Pace**:
- Slightly slower than conversation
- Give time for points to land
- Pause after important statements
- Don't rush

**Body Language**:
- Natural hand gestures (if camera angle allows)
- Lean slightly forward (shows engagement)
- Maintain eye contact with camera lens
- Smile where appropriate

**Authenticity Over Perfection**:
- It's okay to be conversational
- Don't aim for "perfect" TV presenter
- Be yourself, just slightly amplified
- People buy from humans, not robots

#### Advancing Slides

**Timing**:
- Advance slides every 15-30 seconds
- Coordinate with your script sections
- Don't change slides mid-sentence (awkward)
- Pause briefly when changing slides

**Methods**:
- Keyboard: Arrow keys or spacebar
- Clicker: Remote presentation clicker (wireless)
- Assistant: Someone else advances for you (ideal but not necessary)

**Recommended**: Wireless clicker for smooth, professional advancement

#### Handling Mistakes

**Minor Mistakes** (small stutter, word fumble):
- Keep going, don't stop
- Self-correct naturally ("What I mean is...")
- Most won't even notice
- Can edit out in post

**Major Mistakes** (lose place, major brain freeze):
- Pause
- Take a breath
- "Let me rephrase that..."
- Back up a sentence or two
- Continue forward
- Note timestamp for editing later

**Technical Issues** (slide won't advance, audio cuts out):
- Stop recording
- Fix issue
- Resume from that section
- Edit together in post

### Recording in Sections (Advanced)

Instead of one long take, record in sections:

**Benefits**:
- Easier to maintain energy
- Can re-record just one section if needed
- Less pressure (not all-or-nothing)
- Easier editing

**Process**:
1. Record Introduction section
2. Stop recording
3. Take 2-minute break
4. Start new recording for Problem section
5. Repeat for each section

**Naming Files**:
- "VSL-Intro-Take1.mp4"
- "VSL-Problem-Take1.mp4"
- "VSL-Solution-Take1.mp4"
- Easy to organize and edit

### Multiple Takes Strategy

Don't expect to nail it in one take:

**Take 1**:
- Purpose: Get comfortable, find your rhythm
- Often not usable, that's okay
- Warm-up take

**Take 2**:
- Purpose: Better energy, fewer mistakes
- Usually a solid option
- If good enough, might use

**Take 3**:
- Purpose: Your best take
- Confident, natural, polished
- Usually the winner

**Diminishing Returns**:
- After 3 takes, you often get worse (tired, overthinking)
- Don't record 10 takes
- If take 3 isn't great, take a break and return later

### Monitoring During Recording

**Watch For**:
- Audio levels: Staying in proper range
- Focus: Camera still sharp
- Framing: Haven't moved out of frame
- Time: Not going way over/under planned length

**Don't Obsess**:
- Don't stare at OBS preview entire time
- Trust your setup
- Focus on delivery
- Quick glances at audio meter only

### Ending the Recording

**Final Section**:
- Deliver your Call to Action clearly
- Repeat booking link/next step
- Final compelling statement
- Hold for 3 seconds

**Stop Recording**:
- Click "Stop Recording" or hit hotkey
- Wait for OBS to finalize file (progress bar appears)
- Don't close OBS until file is written

**Verify Recording Saved**:
- Navigate to your recording folder
- Confirm file exists
- Check file size (shouldn't be 0 KB or suspiciously small)
- Quick playback check (first 10 seconds, last 10 seconds)

### Immediately After Recording

**Create Backup**:
- Duplicate file to external drive or cloud
- Raw recordings are precious
- Don't lose them

**Take Notes**:
- While fresh in memory, note:
  - Timestamps of mistakes to edit out
  - Sections that felt off
  - Parts you want to re-record
  - Overall feeling about the take

**Download Recordings from Cloud** (if using OBS cloud):
- Don't rely on cloud alone
- Download to local storage
- Backup to multiple locations

**File Naming Convention**:
- "2025-01-15_ServiceName-VSL_Take1.mp4"
- Date + Project + Take Number
- Easy to find and organize

- Adding variety to maintain attention
- Demonstrating physical products

### Using Multiple Scenes

**Scene 1: Full VSL Layout** (Camera + Slides)

**Scene 2: Full-Screen Slides** (For detailed breakdowns)

**Scene 3: Camera Only** (For intro/outro or personal stories)

**Switching Between Scenes**:
- Hotkeys for each scene
- Switch live during recording
- Or create transitions in edit

### OBS Plugins

**StreamFX**:
- Advanced filters and effects
- 3D transforms
- Blur effects

**Move Transition**:
- Smooth movement animations
- Zoom effects
- Position transitions

## Final Recording Tips

### Mindset

**You're Not Performing, You're Helping**:
- This VSL helps someone solve a problem
- You're the guide, not an entertainer
- Authenticity > Perfection

**The Camera is a Person**:
- Talk to the camera like it's a prospect on Zoom
- Friendly, conversational, helpful
- Not overly salesy or pushy

**First Take is Warm-Up**:
- Don't expect perfection immediately
- Take 2-3 is usually best
- Each take gets better

### Technical Excellence

**Test Everything**:
- Never assume equipment works
- Always test record before full take
- Check playback after recording

**Backup Your Backups**:
- Raw footage is irreplaceable
- Multiple copies, multiple locations
- Don't learn this lesson the hard way

**Invest in Quality**:
- Good mic > Good camera
- Good lighting > Good mic
- All three together = professional VSL

### Content Excellence

**Creative Brief First**:
- 60% research, 40% execution
- Don't skip the strategy
- Lazy research = lazy writing = poor VSL

**Congruency is King**:
- Ad message = VSL hook = Landing page copy
- One consistent message throughout
- Power of One concept

**Proof Stacks Credibility**:
- Case studies > Features
- Specific numbers > Vague claims
- Real results > Promises
