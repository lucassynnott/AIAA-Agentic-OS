# Write VSL Script

## Purpose
Create a compelling Video Sales Letter script that speaks to prospects' desires and pain points, leading them to book a sales call or purchase.

## When to Use
- Creating a new VSL for landing pages
- Refreshing existing VSL that's not converting
- A/B testing new angles or messaging
- Client needs video sales materials

## Prerequisites
- Clear offer definition
- Target audience pain points identified
- Desired outcome/CTA defined
- Competitive research completed
- **Market Research Data**: Validated pain points and "Old Mechanism" failures.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Create VSL Creative Brief
**Inputs:**
- Business/offer description
- Target audience ICP
- Main pain points (3-5)
- Desired transformation
- Proof elements (case studies, testimonials)
- Unique mechanism/approach

**Output:** Structured brief document

### 2. Research Phase
- Analyze competitor VSLs
- Review customer testimonials for language
- **Identify pre-existing desires** (don't try to create new ones)
- **Map Three Dimensions of Desire**:
  - **Urgency**: How immediate/pressing is this problem?
  - **Scope**: How many people have this problem?
  - **Intensity**: How powerful/painful is this desire?
- Identify emotional triggers (10 fears, 8 desires)
- Map out objections to address
- Gather proof elements (proof > claims)

### 3. VSL Structure

#### Hook (First 10 seconds)
- Pattern interrupt
- Bold claim or question
- Relate to viewer's pain
- **Example:** "If you're struggling to get clients despite doing everything 'right', this might be the most important video you watch this year..."

#### Problem Agitation (30-60 seconds)
- Paint the current painful reality
- **Use intensification technique**: Amplify existing desires with vivid, emotional language
- **Apply Three Dimensions of Desire**:
  - URGENCY: "Every day you wait costs you..."
  - SCOPE: "847 agencies are dealing with this right now..."
  - INTENSITY: Use vivid language showing pain/consequences
- Show consequences of inaction
- Build urgency
- **Example:** "You're posting content daily, running ads, sending cold outreach... but the clients just aren't coming. And every day that passes, your runway gets shorter. Meanwhile, you're watching competitors land clients with what seems like less effort..."

#### Solution Introduction (20-30 seconds)
- Introduce your unique mechanism
- Differentiate from what they've tried
- **Example:** "What if I told you the problem isn't your work ethic... it's that you're using B2C strategies in a B2B world?"

#### Credibility & Proof (45-60 seconds)
- **PROOF > CLAIMS**: Lead with specific proof before making claims
- **Bigger Promise + Bigger Proof**: Match your boldest promise with your strongest proof
- Your background/authority (Cialdini: Authority principle)
- Social proof and results (Cialdini: Social proof principle)
- Case study highlights with specific numbers
- **Use "because" statements**: "This works because..."
- **Example:** "I've helped 847 agencies land their first $10k client using this exact system. Like Sarah's agency—she went from $2k/mo to $23k/mo in 90 days because she implemented the 3-step framework I'm about to show you..."

#### Deep Dive on Solution (2-3 minutes)
- Explain the mechanism
- **Apply Reasons Why Framework**:
  1. Why this solution is best
  2. Why they should believe it
  3. Why they should act now
- Show how it solves their problem
- Address key objections with "because" statements
- Paint the future transformation (tap into desires, not fears)

#### Offer & CTA (30-45 seconds)
- Clear next step
- **Risk reversal/guarantee** (reduce fear of commitment)
- **Create urgency/scarcity** (Cialdini: Scarcity principle)
  - Hard scarcity: "Only 12 spots available"
  - Time-based: "Enrollment closes Friday"
- Friction-free action
- **Example:** "Click the button below to book your strategy call. We only have 12 spots left this week because we personally work with each client. If you don't see results in 30 days, we'll work with you for free until you do. Click below now..."

### 4. Emotional Targeting Framework

Before scripting, identify which emotions drive your audience:

**10 Common Fears to Address:**
- Unknown, Embarrassment, Failure, Poverty/Loss, Dependence, Betrayal

**8 Common Desires to Tap Into:**
- Freedom, Success, Acceptance, Peace of Mind, Optimism, Fulfillment

**Application in VSL:**
- **Hook**: Tap into fear/desire immediately
- **Problem**: Intensify the fear/frustration
- **Solution**: Show path to desire fulfillment
- **Proof**: Demonstrate others achieved the desire
- **CTA**: Final push using desire + urgency

### 5. Script Writing Framework

**For Each Section:**
1. Write headline/main point
2. Add supporting evidence (proof before claims)
3. Include transition to next section
4. Sprinkle emotional triggers (fears/desires)
5. Use conversational language
6. **Insert "because" statements** for compliance

**Copywriting Techniques:**
- Use "you" language (2nd person)
- Short sentences for impact
- Power words (discover, proven, guaranteed)
- Specificity (847 agencies, not "hundreds")
- Open loops (create curiosity)
- **Blending technique**: Weave multiple persuasive elements throughout
- Lead with proof, then make claims

### 6. Turn Script into Gamma Doc
- Format for teleprompter reading
- Add scene directions
- Mark emphasis points
- Include timing markers
- Add B-roll suggestions
