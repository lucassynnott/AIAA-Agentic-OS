# Write Long Form VSL Script (10-20 Minutes)

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive, story-driven Video Sales Letter (1,500 - 3,500 words) that deeply educates prospects, dismantles beliefs, and builds high conviction before the pitch.

## When to Use
- High-ticket offers ($2k+)
- Cold traffic (who need more trust/context)
- Complicated offers requiring detailed education
- "Mechanism-heavy" solutions

## Prerequisites
- **Market Research Data**: You must have a clear understanding of the "False Mechanism" (what they tried before) and the "Common Beliefs" to dismantle.
- **Founder Story**: validated by research or user input.

## Core Philosophy: The Educational sales Letter
Unlike a Mini VSL which assumes problem awareness, a Long Form VSL must **create** the problem awareness and then **educate** on the solution. The goal is to make the viewer feel *smarter* for having watched it.

## Execution Formula (The 12-Step Framework)

### Phase 1: The Hook (0:00 - 2:00)
1.  **Pattern Interrupt**: Call out the specific audience and their pain immediately.
2.  **The "Elephant in the Room"**: Address why they are skeptical (e.g., "You've tried X, Y, and Z").
3.  **The Big Promise**: What will they learn *today*? (Not what they will buy, what they will *learn*).

### Phase 2: The Story & Struggle (2:00 - 5:00)
4.  **The "Before" State**: Tell a story (yours or a client's) detailing the specific struggle. Use sensory details.
5.  **The "False Mechanism"**: Identify the thing they *thought* was the solution (e.g., "I thought I just needed to run more ads").
6.  **The Hitting Bottom**: The moment the old way failed completely.

### Phase 3: The Epiphany & The New Mechanism (5:00 - 10:00)
7.  **The Discovery**: "Then I discovered..." (The transition point).
8.  **The Unique Mechanism**: Explain the NEW way.
    *   **Deep Dive**: You MUST explain the logic. Use analogies. Show diagrams.
    *   *Example*: "Instead of digging a well (Old Way), we tap into the city water line (New Way)."
9.  **Dismantling Objections**: Address "But what about X?" directly in the script.

### Phase 4: The Offer & Close (10:00 - End)
10. **The Transition**: "Now, you can do this yourself, or..."
11. **The Stack**: List every deliverable + its value.
12. **The "Crossroads" Close**: "You have two choices today..." (Urgency + Scarcity).

## Critical Requirements
1.  **Length**: Must be at least **1,500 words**.
2.  **Story**: Must include a personal or client origin story.
3.  **Visual Cues**: You must describe the charts/graphs to be shown for the Mechanism.
4.  **Tone**: Educational, authoritative, empathetic.
