## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your email list is an owned asset that compounds. Unlike social followers, you control your list. Every email captured is a potential customer for years to come.

**The List Growth Equation**:
```
List Growth = Traffic × Capture Rate × List Quality
```

**Key Metrics**:
- Popup conversion rate: 3-8% target
- Mobile vs desktop capture: Often 60/40
- Email + SMS capture: 40-60% add SMS
- Monthly list growth: 5-15%

**Core Truth**: The money is in the list, but only if the list is healthy (engaged, qualified, consenting).
