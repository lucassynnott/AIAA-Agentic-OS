## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Scaling isn't just "more of the same." Each stage requires different skills, structures, and focus areas.

**The Scaling Path**:
```
Solo ($0-$20K) → First Hire ($20-$50K) → Small Team ($50-$100K) → Organization ($100K+)
```

**Key Truth**: What got you here won't get you there.

## 6. COMMON SCALING MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: Hiring Too Late

**Problem**: Burning out before getting help
**Fix**: Hire when you can afford it, not when you're desperate

### Mistake 2: Hiring Too Fast

**Problem**: Adding overhead before revenue supports it
**Fix**: Hire based on demand, not ambition

### Mistake 3: No Systems

**Problem**: Everything depends on you
**Fix**: Document processes before/as you hire

### Mistake 4: Wrong Hires

**Problem**: Hiring for skill, not fit
**Fix**: Culture and attitude first, skills can be trained

### Mistake 5: Founder Bottleneck
