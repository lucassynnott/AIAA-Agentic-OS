## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Scaling isn't just "more of the same." Each stage requires different skills, structures, and focus areas.

**The Scaling Path**:
```
Solo ($0-$20K) → First Hire ($20-$50K) → Small Team ($50-$100K) → Organization ($100K+)
```

**Key Truth**: What got you here won't get you there.

> This document uses simplified stages. Fazio's more granular breakdown:
> - Stage 1 ($0-10K): Manual outreach, case study acquisition
> - Stage 2 ($10K-30K): Systematization, YouTube, email list building
> - Stage 3 ($30K-100K): Paid ads viable, team building
>
> **Critical Threshold: Don't run paid ads until $30K/month** with $6-10K/month ad budget.

## 2. STAGE 1: SOLO ($0-$20K/mo)

### Focus

- Get clients
- Deliver results
- Build proof
- Learn what works

### Priorities

1. Sales and lead generation
2. Service delivery
3. Building case studies
4. Refining offer

### Key Metrics

- Monthly revenue
- Client count
- Close rate
- Retention

### Exit Criteria

- Consistent $15-20K/month
- 3+ months stability
- Proven delivery system
- Time is the bottleneck

---

## 3. STAGE 2: FIRST HIRE ($20-$50K/mo)

### Focus

- Leverage through people
- Document processes
- Maintain quality
- Keep selling

### First Hire Options

**Delivery**: Someone to do the work
**Sales**: Someone to book/close calls
**Operations**: Someone to handle admin

**Recommendation**: Usually delivery first—free yourself to sell.

> **📊 CROSS-REFERENCE/STANDARDIZED: First Hire Timing (FIX #25)**
>
> First hire depends on **business model**. Use this decision tree:
>
> | Business Model | First Hire | Revenue Trigger | Rationale |
> |----------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
> | Service-heavy (fulfillment bottleneck) | Service Delivery | $15-20K/month | Free yourself to sell |
> | High-volume outreach (cold email, DMs) | Admin/Inbox Manager | Day 1 of outreach | Volume requires immediate support |
> | Sales-heavy (you are fulfillment) | Sales Support | $20K/month | You can't do both at scale |
> | Content-focused | Thumbnail/Video Editor | After 100 videos | Build skills first |
>
> **Key insight:** The $15-20K threshold applies to service delivery roles. Admin/inbox roles can come earlier if your model is volume-based.

**Fix**: Hire based on demand, not ambition

### Mistake 3: No Systems

**Problem**: Everything depends on you
**Fix**: Document processes before/as you hire
