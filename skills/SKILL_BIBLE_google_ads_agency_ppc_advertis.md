## Core Principles

1. **AI-Powered Lead Generation Over Cold Outreach**: Use Apollo.io and ChatGPT to systematically identify and reach high-value prospects rather than relying on traditional networking or referrals.

2. **Portfolio-Driven Sales Process**: Demonstrate capability through documented case studies with specific metrics (CTR improvements, ROAS increases, cost reductions) rather than credentials or certifications.

3. **Systematic Service Delivery**: Create standardized processes for campaign setup, optimization, and reporting that can be replicated across clients for consistent results.

4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Track every metric, test systematically, and make optimization decisions based on performance data rather than assumptions or industry best practices.

5. **International Market Focus**: Target global clients who pay premium rates rather than competing in saturated local markets with price-sensitive businesses.

6. **Automation-First Approach**: Build systems and processes that reduce manual work while maintaining quality, enabling scalability without proportional increases in labor.

7. **Continuous Skill Evolution**: Stay ahead of platform changes and industry trends through systematic learning and adaptation of new tools and techniques.
