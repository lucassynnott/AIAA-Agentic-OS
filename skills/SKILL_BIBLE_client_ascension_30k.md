# SKILL BIBLE: Agency/B2B Business to $30K/mo System

> Source: Daniel Fazio (Client Ascension)
> Context: Complete system to scale from $5-15K to $30K/mo without ads - the prerequisite before paid traffic

---

## Executive Summary

$30K/mo is the threshold where you can start running ads. Below that, you don't have the cash flow or emotional capacity to handle ad spend risk. This system uses cold email, dream 100, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter to reach $30K without paid traffic - all while only selling to rich people.

## The #1 Rule: Stop Selling to Poor People

### The CAC to LTV Analysis

**Typical Poor-Client Scenario:**
```
Spend: $30K (time + money)
Cost per qualified call: $300
Close rate: 15%
Closes: 15
CAC: $2,000
Price: $3,000/month
Gross margin: 70%
Churn: 20% (5 month retention)
LTV Gross Profit: $10,500
LTV:CAC Ratio: 5.25x
```

**The Problem:** 5.25x is NOT enough to scale. You need 10x minimum.

### What Happens When You Sell to Rich People

```
Cost per qualified call: $450 (goes UP)
Close rate: 30% (doubles or more)
Price: $3,300/month (goes UP 10%)
Churn: 10% (halves)
LTV:CAC Ratio: 15.75x (TRIPLES)
```

**Triple amplification:**
1. Close rate increases dramatically
2. Price increases
3. Churn decreases massively

### The Show Rate Effect

> "When you're selling to poor people, you have like a 50% no-show rate. Rich people show up at 70-80%, sometimes 90%."

### The Mansion Analogy

> "If you're trying to sell a $3,000/month service, imagine you're a real estate agent selling a $2 million mansion. You'd ask for proof of funds before showing the house. Why would you waste time on people who can't afford it?"

### The Virus Effect

> "Even if the poor person somehow does have money and you sign them, they are EVERY single amount of headache you get forever. One poor client infests the entire operation of your company, your psyche, your emotional stability."

**Poor clients cause:**
- Complaints
- Refund requests
- Bad results (they need it to work too desperately)
- You questioning your competence
- Entire system degradation

### The 5 Variables That Determine Success

| Variable | If Broken |
|----------|-----------|
| Offer Strength | System fails |
| Speed of Response | System fails |
| Follow-up Frequency | System fails |
| Deliverability | System fails |
| Script Quality | System fails |

> "This system only works if ALL of these are concurrently optimized. If ONE is off, the whole system goes down."

### Which Strategy to Use?

> "It's a math question, not a feeling question."

Model it out:
- What's the response rate?
- What's the positive response rate?
- What's the call booking rate?
- What's the close rate?

**Financial Model Example (500 emails/day):**
```
Emails: 500/day × 28 days = 14,000/month
Response rate: 3%
Positive response: 20%
Call booking: 20%
Close rate: 20%

Result: 6 calls/month, 1 close
Cost per call: $89
CAC: $443
LTV:CAC: 24x
```

### The Cash Flow Reality (Why People Quit)

```
Week 1: -$593 (setup costs)
Week 2: $0
Week 3: $0
Week 4: $0
Week 5: -$473 (renewals)
Week 6: +$2,210 (first close!)
```

> "Most people are on week 3 saying 'this doesn't work' and they stop. They don't understand there's a TIME DELAY in everything good in life."

**Month-by-month at 500 emails/day:**
- Month 1: -$593
- Month 2: +$1,800
- Month 3: +$4,500
- Month 4: +$9,000
- Month 5: +$18,900

**At 1,000 emails/day:**
- Month 5: +$38,000

## Traffic Source 2: Dream 100

### The Rules

1. **Identify TOP OF MARKET leads** (rich people only)
2. **Manual outreach** (turbo personalized)
3. **Offer:** Free deliverable, risk reduction offer, or free audit

- 72 hours
- 7 days

Month 12: 89,000 views (400x month 1)

Total views year 1: 191,952
Opt-ins: 3,839

## The Spread Visualization

### How Scaling Actually Works

```
Week 1: Spend → Negative
Week 2: Spend → More negative
Week 3: Spend → More negative
Week 4: First close → Break even
Week 5: Spend → Slightly negative
Week 6: More closes → 1.2x return
Week 7: Spend → Slightly negative
Week 8: More closes → 1.4x return
...
Week 20: 2x return
```

> "The spread keeps getting wider and wider. ALL the profit is in the spread. People screw up because they don't let the spread get wide enough."
