## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Creative is 80%+ of ad performance. The best targeting and funnel won't save a bad ad. Your creative must stop the scroll, capture attention, and compel action.

**The Creative Hierarchy**:
```
Hook (70%) > Body (20%) > CTA (10%)
```

**Key Insight**: You have 1-3 seconds to stop the scroll. The hook is everything.

**The Scroll-Stop Equation**:
```
Attention = (Pattern Interrupt × Relevance × Curiosity) / Competition
```

## 2. WHAT MAKES A GOOD AD

### The 3 Requirements

**1. Stop the Scroll** (Hook)
- Pattern interrupt
- Unexpected element
- Direct call-out

**2. Hold Attention** (Body)
- Relevant message
- Clear value
- Compelling story

**3. Drive Action** (CTA)
- Clear next step
- Low friction
- Urgency

### Hyper-Contextual Messaging

Your ad must feel like it was made specifically for the viewer.

**Generic**: "Struggling with sales?"
**Hyper-Contextual**: "Still spending 4 hours a day on cold calls with nothing to show for it?"

The more specific, the more it resonates.
