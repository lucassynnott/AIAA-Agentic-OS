## Executive Summary

A funnel is the theoretical but very real process that moves someone from not knowing who you are to becoming a real paying client. This skill bible provides the complete architecture, every page type, every metric to track, and every bottleneck to diagnose.

## The Complete Funnel Architecture

```
Traffic (Content/Ads)
    ↓
[From Content] → Opt-in Page (Lead Magnet) → Thank You + VSSL
[From Ads] → Direct to VSSL Page (skip opt-in)
    ↓
Application Form
    ↓
[Qualified] → Book Call (embedded in TypeForm)
[Disqualified] → DQ Page (downsell)
    ↓
Thank You/Confirmation Page
    ↓
Email Flows (Welcome, Pre-Call, Follow-up)
    ↓
Sales Call
    ↓
Client or Follow-up
```

## Critical Architecture Decision: Opt-in Pages

### From Content: Use Opt-in Page

**Why:**
- 43%+ completion rate from YouTube
- They've watched hours of your content
- Already know, like, trust you
- Lead magnet adds value

### From Ads: Skip Opt-in Page

**Why:**
- Opt-in page only converts 10-30%
- You're excluding 70-90% of qualified people
- Business owners want facts fast
- Low friction = more opportunities

> "You're actually hurting yourself quite a bit by running ads to an opt-in page when targeting business owners or wealthier individuals."

---

## Page 1: Opt-in Page (Content Traffic Only)

### Purpose

Trade free value for contact information.

### Structure (Keep Simple)

- What is the lead magnet?
- What will they get?
- Form (name, email, phone, website, revenue)

**Do NOT:**
- Make it complicated
- Add scrolling content
- Over-explain

### Metrics

- 43%+ completion rate from content
- 10-20% from ads (why we skip for ads)

---

## Page 2: VSSL Page (Sales Page)

### Purpose

Provide enough information to make them want to book a call.

> "The number one reason people don't book calls is they just don't have enough information."

### Required Elements

1. **Headline** - Clear, compelling
2. **Social Proof** - At the top
3. **Who It's For** - Call out your ICP
4. **VSSL Video** - Your face, explaining the offer
5. **Apply Now Button**
6. **Plain English Explanation:**
   - What is the goal?
   - Who is this for?
   - What do you get?
   - Why should you do it?
   - How much does it cost?
   - How to get started?
   - FAQs
   - Social proof/testimonials

### VSSL vs DSL

**Use VSSL (Video Sales Letter) when:**
- Comfortable on camera
- Good at communicating
- Play rate/engagement is decent

**Use DSL (Deck Sales Letter) when:**
- Don't want face on it (privacy/doxxing concerns)
- Terrible at making videos
- Play rate/engagement is <5%
- Targeting old people or home services

**DSL Format:**
- Google Slides
- ~70 slides
- Click through at own pace
- Same content as VSSL, just in text/image format

---

## Page 3: Application Form (TypeForm)

### Purpose

Qualify leads before they book calls.

### Critical Questions

1. **Disqualifiers** - Kick out unqualified
   - "Are you a service-based B2B owner?"
   - "Do you have clients already?"
   - "Do you have 1+ hour/day to work on this?"

2. **Revenue** (Multiple Choice) - For CRM syncing
   - 0-10K, 10-50K, 50-250K, 250K-1M, 1M+

3. **Price Confirmation** - Show price, confirm OK
   - "This costs $X-Y/month. Are you okay with this?"

4. **Website** - Allows pre-call research

5. **Contact Info** - Name, email, phone

6. **Source** - "Where did you learn about us?"

7. **Timeline** - "When are you looking to join?"
   - 90+ days out = disqualify (optional)

### Form vs Separate Calendly Page

**Embed Calendly IN TypeForm:**
- Must book call to submit application
- 70-80% book rate

**Separate Calendly Page:**
- Can submit without booking
- 50% book rate (50% drop-off)

---

## Page 4: DQ (Disqualification) Page

### Purpose

Monetize unqualified leads.

### Options

- **Downsell** - Lower-priced offer (course, program)
- **Cross-sell** - Different offer that fits them
- **Referral** - Send to partner, collect fee
- **Just Sorry** - Fine if no alternatives

**Example:**
- Under $30K/month revenue → Redirect to $97/month School community
- Get some revenue from otherwise lost lead

---

## Page 5: Thank You/Confirmation Page

### Purpose

Increase show rate and prepare them for call.

> "The reason people don't show up is the same reason they don't book calls - not enough information."

### Required Elements

1. **Basic Rundown** - What to expect on the call
2. **Accept Unknown Sender** - Especially for Google Calendar
3. **Contact Option** - "Text me if you want"
4. **Top 3 FAQ Videos** (1-3 min each):
   - Time-related: "How exactly does this work?"
   - Price-related: "How will I get ROI?"
   - Trust-related: "Why should I trust you?"
5. **More Social Proof** - Equivalent to VSSL page
6. **Watch YouTube** - "Watch my channel before the call"

### The Principle

> "Treat this page like a sales rep. You're trying to close them on this page."

**Whatever you're sick of talking about on calls → Put it on thank you page**

### Show Rate Impact

- Without optimization: 30-40% show rate
- With optimization: 60-80% show rate (higher from content)

---

## Email Flows

### Flow 1: Welcome Flow

**Trigger:** When they opt-in (submit lead magnet form)

**Purpose:** Educate and nurture over 30 days

**Structure:**
- 30 emails
- One objection/FAQ per email
- Mix of stories, examples, case studies

### Flow 2: Pre-Call Flow

**Trigger:** When they book a call

**Action:** Remove from Welcome Flow, add to Pre-Call Flow

**Volume:** More than you think
- 18 emails
- One every 4-6 hours
- 3 days before call

**Content:**
- Condensed version of Welcome Flow
- Case studies
- Objection handling
- How it works
- What to expect

**The Concern:**
> "A lot of people are lame. They think 'I'm going to annoy them.'"

**Reality:**
- ~10% will say "stop spamming me" (weren't serious anyway)
- ~90% will have 70-80% open rates
- You're doing them a favor
- They booked because they WANT this information

### Flow 3: Follow-up Flow

**Trigger:** After sales call (didn't close)

**Content:**
- Same structure as Welcome/Pre-Call
- References the call that happened
- Next steps to get started

---

## Retargeting Ads (If 400+ Calls/Month)

### Purpose

Force-feed objection handling before sales call.

### Why 400+ Calls Minimum

- Need 100+ people in custom audience for ads to deliver
- Facebook loses ~75% in matching
- 400 calls/month → 100 matched → Ads deliver

### Structure

~60 one-minute videos:
- Each hammers out specific objection
- Short form (Reels, Shorts, Stories)

---

## The Bottlenecks

### Bottleneck 1: Traffic

**Symptom:** Not enough clicks

**Metrics:**

## The Vehicle Analogy

> "You need every single piece of a funnel for it to function properly."

**If you had every piece of a car except the steering wheel:** Useless
**If you had every piece except the brakes:** Useless

**Same with funnels:**
- Every piece except follow-up → 3x lower close rate
- Every piece except good landing page → 4x lower conversion

**The 6/10 Rule:**
> "Having all pieces at 6/10 quality is 5,000 times better than having half of them at 10/10 quality."

---

## The Statistics

- 97.1% of Facebook advertisers never get a single conversion
- All of Facebook's billions comes from 2.9% who do
- 4% of businesses hit $1M/year
- 0.6% hit $10M/year

> "Just by knowing this is what you should have, you're in the top 5%. If you implement it, you're in the top 1%."
