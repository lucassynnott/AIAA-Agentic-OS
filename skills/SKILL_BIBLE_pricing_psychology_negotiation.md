## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Price is not about cost—it's about perceived value. How you price, present, and defend your pricing determines your profitability and the clients you attract.

**The Pricing Truth**: Price is a confidence signal. Low price = low confidence = low-quality clients.

**The Value Equation**:
```
Perceived Value = (Desired Outcome × Probability of Achievement) / (Time × Effort × Risk)
```

## 2. PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

### Price Anchoring

The first number sets the reference point.

**High Anchor**:
"Most agencies charge $15K/month for this. Our investment is $5K."

**Value Anchor**:
"This will generate $100K in revenue. Your investment is $10K."

**Alternative Anchor**:
"Hiring in-house would cost $120K/year. We're $5K/month."

### The 9 Effect

Prices ending in 9 convert better:
- $997 vs $1,000
- $4,997 vs $5,000

Works for courses and products, less for high-ticket services.

### Price Tiers

Offering 3 options increases close rate:
- **Basic**: Entry point (few buy)
- **Standard**: Target option (most buy)
- **Premium**: Aspirational (anchors value)

The middle option sells best—make it your target.

### Decoy Pricing

Add option that makes target look better:
- Option A: $1,000 (basic)
- Option B: $2,500 (target)
- Option C: $2,700 (everything in B + small extra)

Option C makes B look like great value.

## 3. PRICING STRATEGIES

### Value-Based Pricing

Price based on outcome value, not time/cost.

**Formula**:
```
Price = (Expected Value Delivered) × 10-30%
```

**Example**:
- You'll generate $100K in additional revenue
- Price: $10K-$30K (10-30% of value)

### Competitive Pricing

Price based on market position:
- **Below market**: Compete on price (race to bottom)
- **At market**: Compete on other factors
- **Above market**: Compete on value/differentiation

### Cost-Plus Pricing

Price = Cost + Margin

**Problem**: Ignores value delivered
**Use only**: When you can't quantify value

### Performance-Based Pricing

Pay tied to results:
- Revenue share (10-20%)
- Pay-per-lead/call
- Bonuses for hitting targets

**Pros**: Easy to sell, aligned incentives
**Cons**: Unpredictable revenue, depends on factors outside your control

## 4. PRESENTING PRICE

### When to Present

**After Value Established**:
- After discovery (understand their situation)
- After demonstrating solution
- After showing proof
- After building trust

**Never Before**: Understanding their needs and communicating value.

### How to Present

**The Value-First Frame**:
```
"Based on what you've shared, we can help you achieve [result].

Similar clients have seen [specific outcome].

To get started and get you those results, the investment is [price]."
```

**The ROI Frame**:
```
"You mentioned your average client is worth $5K.

If we get you just 10 additional clients this year, that's $50K.

Your investment for that would be $5K/month, or $60K for the year.

So you're looking at nearly a 100% return—and that's conservative."
```

### Price Delivery Tips

- State with confidence (no flinching)
- Silence after stating price
- Don't immediately justify
- Let them respond first

## 5. HANDLING PRICE OBJECTIONS

### "It's Too Expensive"

**Translation**: "I don't see the value exceeding the cost."

**Response Framework**:
1. Acknowledge
2. Clarify
3. Reframe to value
4. Compare to alternatives

**Example**:
```
"I understand—it's a significant investment.

Can I ask—what are you comparing it to?

[Listen]

When you think about [the result we discussed], and what that's worth to your business, how does the investment look?

Also, consider that [alternative like hiring] would cost [more] and take [longer]."
```

### "I Need to Think About It"

**Translation**: Could be price, could be something else.

**Response**:
```
"Totally understand. Just so I can help—what specifically do you need to think about?

Is it the investment, the timing, or something about how we work?"
```

### "Can You Do It for Less?"

**Response Options**:

**Hold Firm**:
"I appreciate you asking. Our pricing reflects the value and results we deliver. We've found that when we discount, both parties end up compromising."

**Offer Alternative**:
"I can't reduce the price, but I could [offer payment plan / reduce scope / add extra value]."

**Conditional**:
"If we could [longer commitment / case study rights / referral], I could look at adjusting."

### "Competitor is Cheaper"

**Response**:
```
"They might be. There are less expensive options out there.

The question is: what's the cost of going with someone cheaper if they don't deliver?

Our clients come to us because they want [results], not the cheapest option.

What's more important to you—the price or the outcome?"
```

## 6. NEGOTIATION PRINCIPLES

### Never Negotiate Against Yourself

- Don't lower price before they ask
- Don't offer discounts preemptively
- State price, then silence

### Trade, Don't Cave

If you reduce price, reduce scope:
- "I could do $4K instead of $5K if we removed [component]."
- "If we adjusted the scope to [smaller], we could work at [lower price]."

### Create Value, Not Discounts

Instead of lowering price:
- Add bonus
- Extend terms
- Include extra service
- Offer payment plan

### Know Your Walk-Away Point

Before any negotiation, know:
- Your minimum acceptable price
- What you're willing to flex on
- When to walk away

---

## 7. DISCOUNT STRATEGY

### When to Discount

**Acceptable**:
- Case study rights
- Referral commitment
- Long-term contract
- Quick decision

**Not Acceptable**:
- "Just because"
- To match competitor
- Because they asked nicely

### How to Discount

**Always Trade**:
"I can offer 10% off if you sign a 12-month agreement instead of monthly."

**Create Urgency**:
"If you decide by Friday, I can honor [offer]."

**One-Time**:
"This is a one-time offer for our first engagement. Future work will be at standard pricing."

### Discount Limits

- Set maximum discount percentage
- Document in your own policies
- Don't negotiate endlessly

## 8. RAISING PRICES

### When to Raise

- You're at capacity
- Results have improved
- Market has shifted
- You've under-priced

### How to Raise (Existing Clients)

**The Frame**:
```
"Hey [Name], wanted to give you advance notice.

Starting [date], our rate will be increasing to [new price].

Because you've been a great client, I wanted to give you [60 days notice / lock in current rate for X months / etc.].

Let me know if you have any questions."
```

### How to Raise (New Clients)

Just do it. New clients don't know your old price.
