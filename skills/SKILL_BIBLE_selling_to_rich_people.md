## Executive Summary

Selling to rich people is fundamentally different from selling to the general public. Rich people value efficiency, directness, and signals of competence. They have different language patterns, different objections, and different buying behaviors. This skill bible covers the specific adaptations needed to convert high-net-worth individuals.

## Core Psychology of Rich Buyers

### Energy Conservation Maximized

All humans practice energy conservation (evolutionary psychology), but rich people take it to the extreme:

> "Rich people are generally very transactional people. They prefer very efficient deals with outcomes that don't involve a lot of time and effort. They'd rather throw money to generate outcomes."

**Implications:**
- Short, direct communication wins
- Don't waste their time with fluff
- Get to the point immediately
- Make the buying process frictionless

### Scanner Mode vs Justification Mode

**Front-end (Scanner Mode):**
- Scanning for "is this right for me?"
- Not consuming all your content
- Not watching full videos
- Just checking fit quickly

**Back-end (Justification Mode):**
- Only AFTER they raise hand do they dig in
- Then they consume breakout videos
- Then they check credentials
- Then they verify legitimacy

**Example:** IT contractor search
- Called 4 companies, didn't visit websites
- Third company answered professionally
- ONLY THEN clicked to website and socials
- Same with $50K sound system - consumed case studies only after commitment

> "I don't give a shit to consume any of that stuff until I get to the point where I'm technically teed up, ready to actually do the deal."

## Language and Signaling

### The Three Fingers Test

Reference: Inglourious Basterds scene where American signals wrong "three" and gets caught.

Rich people signal to each other through:
- Word choice
- Tone
- Assumptions made
- Questions asked

**One wrong signal = you're not one of them.**

### Money Words

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| Money | Liquidity |
| Cash | Capital |
| Money available | Dry powder |
| How much money | What's your capital position |

Using correct terminology signals you understand their world.

### Application Questions That Fail

**Bad question:** "What's your annual income?"
- 60% of rich people surveyed said they would LIE on this question
- It signals you don't understand them

**Better approaches:**
- Revenue-based qualifying questions
- Business metric questions
- Investment capacity questions

## Funnel Adaptations for Rich People

### What Works

**Call Funnels (Preferred):**
- Direct, low friction
- Most rich people (80%) buy through call funnels
- Skip low-ticket ascension entirely
- Go straight to high-ticket

**Real Data from $35K Offer Event:**
- Only 1 person bought low-ticket first
- 80% bought through call funnel
- 20% bought through 3-day virtual event
- Everyone else went direct to high-ticket

> "Rich people bias towards spending more money because they believe the money is tied to the value and outcomes they're probable to produce."

### What Doesn't Work as Well

**Low-Ticket to High-Ticket:**
- Adds time (which they hate)
- Adds friction
- They want the premium option directly
- See low-ticket as "not getting full solution"

**Long Opt-in Funnels:**
- More friction = fewer conversions
- Rich people don't need "warming up"
- Direct response can do the selling

**Two-Call Closes:**
- Unnecessary friction
- Deters financially qualified buyers
- If they're ready, close them

### Webinars for Rich People

Can work, but different execution:

> "They're not The Secrets. You're not using a bunch of fluff and framing tactics for 30 minutes of a 3-hour presentation."

**Rich people webinars:**
- Very matter-of-fact
- Direct communication
- Sell the narrative more
- Less psychological manipulation
- More respect for intelligence

---

## Sales and Marketing Alignment

### The Symbiotic Relationship

> "Anybody who operates with sales and marketing separate or where those departments point the finger at blame - terrible way to operate. Huge limitations. Massive friction."

**Bad feedback from sales:** "The leads were unqualified" or "The leads were too cold"
- Not actionable
- No improvement path
- Just blame

**Solution:** Record all calls → Feed into AI (like Manis.AI without guardrails) → Get actual actionable insights:
- Specific objection patterns
- Framing gaps
- Backend selling system failures
- Training opportunities

### Trust Between Teams

If sales doesn't trust marketing to fill calendars:
- Won't perpetually hire
- Can't perpetually scale
- Limited to scaling only when sales team has capacity

**The Bottleneck:**
- Sales team takes 3-4 weeks to hire new rep
- Marketing needs calendar slots to book into
- No trust = scaling only every other month (6x/year max)

---

## Backend Selling Systems for Rich People

Still critical, but adapted:

### 1. Confirmation Page Best Practices

**Breakout Videos (Rich People Version):**
- Refund rates and dispute rates
- Deal volume and size
- Years in business
- Case studies with dollar amounts
- NOT just cherry-picked testimonials

**Include negative reviews:**
> "We actually try to get people who refund, who dispute to make a video explaining why this didn't work for them."

This signals confidence and transparency.

### 2. Hammer Them Strategy

- Short form and long form content
- 20 frequency target minimum
- Content categories: Questions, Second Layer Questions, Objections, Expectations
- Run as engagement campaigns (ThruPlay)

### 3. Value Dense Emails

- NOT just "hey you have a call"
- Actual valuable insights
- Information that creates prioritization
- Make them feel smart for booking

### 4. SDR Best Practices

**Personalization critical:**
- Read their application
- Look up their business
- Custom resource list based on their situation
- Selfie videos from reps

**Using AI for personalization:**
- Feed all applications into AI
- Find patterns in pain points
- Have AI suggest content for each lead
- Scale personalization

---

## Pixel Conditioning for Rich People

### The Problem

If you ask "What's your income?" and 60% lie, your pixel learns wrong.

### The Solution

Get qualifying data through proxy questions:
- Business metrics (employees, revenue indicators)
- Investment questions
- Industry-specific qualifiers
- Behavior signals

Send accurate conversion data back to platform → Train pixel on actual qualified buyers.

## Creative Strategy for Rich People

### Meta Andromeda Update (2024)

Meta announced need for:
- Creative diversification
- Multiple "themes" (environments)
- Varied messaging and hooks
- Different "characters" (presenters/styles)

**Example cited:** E-commerce company went from 3-4 creatives/week to 50 creatives/week for consistent scaling.

### Rich People Creative Principles

1. **Direct messaging** - No fluff, get to point
2. **Results-focused** - Outcomes over process
3. **Peer signaling** - Use language they use
4. **Credibility markers** - Deal sizes, client names
5. **Efficiency positioning** - "Save time" over "save money"

---

## Financial Modeling for Rich People Funnels

### Call Funnel Math (Preferred)

- Lower test budget ($30-60K/month viable)
- Daily iteration cycles (20-30/month)
- Faster optimization
- Less cash at risk

### Webinar Math

- $15-25K minimum per webinar test
- Only 4 iteration cycles per month (weekly webinars)
- More variables to optimize
- Higher risk per test

> "From an expectations perspective, that's the most critical thing from a math view that has to be settled."
