# SKILL BIBLE: Offer Positioning That Gets More Clients (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This is Daniel Fazio's framework for positioning any B2B offer to generate maximum client interest, extracted from real discovery conversations with prospects and clients in Client Ascension. The system exposes the fatal flaw in traditional "learn a skill, sell the skill" model: **Prospects are terrified of giving you access to their valuable assets** (email list, ads account) because they fear you'll destroy their reputation or waste their money.

The brutal reality that breaks most positioning: You can't just list what you're good at - you must identify the prospect's exact fears in their own words, understand what they tried and failed, know their conversion journey intimately, and address all of it in your positioning. Most people make up answers to positioning questions instead of extracting them directly from real prospects.

This skill bible documents the exact discovery framework Fazio uses on every Client Ascension sales call: What did they try? Who sold them the failed solution? What are they scared of? What happens if they don't solve this problem? The answers - in their exact syntax and sentence structure - become your positioning language that resonates at a deep emotional level.

**Key Quote:** "What I'm telling you to do is that you need to get it directly from the people you are selling to, and I mean the exact syntax and sentence structure that they are using."

## Section 1: The Fatal Flaw in "Learn a Skill, Sell the Skill"

### The Traditional Model (Why It Fails)

**What You're Taught:**
1. Learn a high-income skill (email marketing, ads, content creation)
2. Get good at that skill
3. Sell that skill to businesses
4. Make money

**Why It Fails:**

**Fazio's Direct Statement:**

"There's a huge problem in the make money online space or anybody who watches a business tutorial video, and it starts with: You're taught to learn a high-income skill and then sell that skill to businesses for money.

Now I know I'm gonna ruffle some feathers here, but **nobody wants to give you access to their email list**. **Nobody wants to give you access to their ads manager** so you can outsource it to a $4/hour VA who similarly has no idea what they're doing.

They're scared. They're scared that you're gonna ruin their reputation to their email list. Or they're scared that you're gonna waste tens of thousands of dollars on their ads manager."

---

### The Two Core Fears

**Fear #1: Reputation Damage**
"They're scared you're gonna ruin their reputation to their email list."

**Fear #2: Financial Loss**
"They're scared you're gonna waste tens of thousands of dollars on their ads manager."

**Fazio's Critical Instruction:**

"Pause. Do you notice those two exact things I just said?
- They're scared you're going to ruin their reputation
- They're scared you're going to waste tens of thousands of dollars on ads

You need to use and identify this precise language of their exact fears."

---

## Section 2: The Discovery Framework (Questions That Extract Truth)

### The Seven Essential Questions

**Fazio's Framework:**

"Here's the questions you need to ask. You need to know:

1. **What they tried and didn't work**
2. **If they bought a course from a fake guru**
3. **Did they spend $20,000 on ads and it didn't work**
4. **Did they try the thing you're selling them but couldn't get it right**
5. **Who is the exact person buying it**
6. **What are they scared of**
7. **What is going to happen to them if they don't solve this specific problem right now**"

---

### The Critical Distinction (Direct vs Invented Answers)

**What Normal People Do (Wrong):**

"Here's what a normal person is gonna do. They're gonna hear these questions and they're gonna sit down, they're gonna write them out, and they're gonna make the answers up. They're going to pull these answers out of a hat."

**What You Must Do (Right):**

"You can't do that. What I'm telling you to do is that you need to get it directly from the people you are selling to, and I mean the exact syntax and sentence structure that they are using."

---

### How to Extract the Real Answers

**Method 1: Client Onboarding Calls**

"I do two things here when people join [Client Ascension]. I'm on a call with them and I simply ask them: **Why did you join?**

Now what they're going to do is go on a tangent and they're going to explain:
- What exactly has happened to them
- What did they try
- What motivated them to get on the call in the first place
- What motivated them to actually join

I'm going to find all of these things. I'm going to find the exact sequence of events that occurred for them to arrive at this exact position right now - a client of mine.

I'm going to get the exact syntax and exact experiences of somebody who has already converted."

**Method 2: Read Your Setter's Messages**

"I read the text messages our setter gets and I get feedback from our sales team."

**Method 3: Attend Sales Meetings**

"I go to every single sales team meeting. I know exactly what the objections are. I know exactly what people are saying in the discovery phase. I know what they're saying they tried. I know what they're saying they're scared of."

**Method 4: Analyze the Pattern**

"If I take those lessons and extrapolate them in marketing angles to the general public and people who are at the top of the funnel and not clients yet, there's a high probability that what the people who have bought are going to also have experienced the exact thing that other people have."

---

## Section 3: Real Example #1 - Security Guard Training

### The Initial Offer (Weak Positioning)

**What the Service Is:**
"He trains security guards to be more aware."

**Fazio's First Question:**
"Why would a security guard buy a training on how to be more aware?"

**The Trick Question:**
"They don't. It's the owner of a security company who employs the security guards."

---

### Digging Deeper (The Discovery Process)

**Level 1:**
"Let's go deeper again. Why do security company owners buy this from him?"

**Student's Response:**
[Thinks for a moment, unsure]

**Level 2:**
"What happens when a security company's security guards are not more aware?"

**Answer:**
"One: They get in more violent altercations."

**Level 3:**
"Okay, so let's go deeper again. What happens when a security company owner's security guards get in more violent altercations?"

**Now we really sat here and thought about it for a minute, and this is what we came up with:**

---

### The Three Real Outcomes (Root Level)

**1. Insurance Consequences**
"Their insurance rates will go up OR their insurance companies will completely drop them and they cannot be in business any longer."

**2. Reputation Damage**
"It will ruin the brand reputation of their client AND them because they will be permanently associated with violence."

**3. Employee Churn Costs**
"If the guards are not aware and they get in too many violent altercations, they churn more. So if they aren't trained properly, the employee churn is higher and he needs to keep hiring people continuously, which is a cost in and of itself."

---

### The Transformation (Before vs After)

**Before (Weak):**
"We train security guards to be more aware."

**After (Strong):**
"Security company owners: We show you how to:
- Keep your insurance rates low
- Keep your brand reputation high
- Make your employees churn less

Here's how: [VSL] [Calendly booking link below]

Bam. Full sales page ready and primed to get clients with cold email easily."

---

### Why The After Version Works

**Addresses Real Fears:**
- Insurance rates (financial fear)
- Brand reputation (reputation fear)
- Employee churn (operational fear)

**Uses Their Language:**
- "Insurance rates" (their exact terminology)
- "Brand reputation" (how they think about it)
- "Employee churn" (their operational metric)

**Quantifiable Outcomes:**
- Not "better security" (vague)
- But "lower insurance rates" (measurable)

**Immediate Relevance:**
- Every security company owner worries about these three things
- Hits pain points directly

---

## Section 4: Real Example #2 - Client Ascension Positioning

### The Discovery Process (How Fazio Built His Own Positioning)

**Method 1: Post-Purchase Interviews**

"When people join I'm on a call with them and I simply ask them: **Why did you join?**

Now what they're going to do is go on a tangent and they're going to explain what exactly has happened to them, what did they try, what motivated them to get on the call in the first place, what motivated them to actually join.

Now I'm going to find all of these things. I'm going to find the exact sequence of events that occurred for them to arrive at this exact position right now - a client of mine.

I'm going to get the exact syntax and exact experiences of somebody who has already converted."

**Method 2: Sales Team Intelligence**

"I read the text messages our setter gets and I get feedback from our sales team. I go to every single sales team meeting. I know exactly what the objections are. I know exactly what people are saying in the discovery phase."

---

### What Fazio Discovered (The Patterns)

**What They Tried (That Failed):**

**1. Ads**
"Ads - they didn't work. They wasted $30,000 on it."

**2. Coaching Programs**
"They bought coaching products from other people that didn't work."

**3. Cold Email (But Failed)**
"They already tried cold email. They couldn't get it to work."

**Specific Failures Within Cold Email:**
- They couldn't get enough leads
- They couldn't get enough replies
- They couldn't get their emails delivered
- When they did get replies, they couldn't convert them to calls

**Fazio's Response:**
"We have the solutions to all of these and I present this in the marketing angles."

---

### What They're Scared Of (In Their Exact Words)

**Fear #1:**
"Relying on outside agencies to keep their business alive."

**Fear #2:**
"Having to go back to working a 9-5 job."

**Fear #3:**
"Needing to raise VC money to have a successful business."

**Fazio's Note:**
"This is the exact wording from real prospects who are coming into our funnel. It's what they've tried, what they've failed, what they're scared of."

---

### The Final Positioning (Built from Discovery)

**Client Ascension Value Proposition:**

"B2B companies, marketing agencies, consultants, and freelancers:

We show you how to turn 100 cold prospects into paying customers **without spending thousands on ads** and **without relying on outside agencies to keep your business alive**."

---

### Why This Positioning Is Powerful

**Addresses Exact Fears (In Their Words):**
- "Without spending thousands on ads" → Addresses the $30K wasted on ads
- "Without relying on outside agencies" → Addresses fear of dependence

**Acknowledges What They Tried:**
- Implies they've tried ads (failed)
- Implies they've tried agencies (unreliable)

**Promises Specific Outcome:**
- "Turn 100 cold prospects into paying customers"
- Quantifiable, clear, measurable

**Target Market Crystal Clear:**
- B2B companies
- Marketing agencies
- Consultants
- Freelancers

---

## Section 5: The Speed & Certainty Layer

### The Two Conversion Factors

**Fazio's Insight:**

"What do people care about? **Speed** and **certainty**."

**Speed:** How fast will I get results?
**Certainty:** How sure am I that this will work?

---

### Injecting Speed Into Positioning

**Client Ascension's Speed Elements:**

**Week 1:**
"They come in..."

**Week 2:**
"We write their cold email scripts for them. We give them the first 500 leads for free. We give them the sending app for the cold emails for free. They're literally sending cold emails by week 2."

**Week 3:**
"Generating sales calls in week 3."

**The Speed Promise:**
- Scripts written FOR them (not taught how to write)
- 500 leads provided FREE (no hunting for leads)
- Sending tool provided FREE (no setup barrier)
- Sending emails within 14 days (not months)
- Calls booked within 21 days (tangible results fast)

---

### Injecting Certainty Into Positioning

**Certainty Element #1: Guarantee**
"We guarantee they get results."

**Certainty Element #2: Social Proof**
"We show them other people who are actively getting results right now."

**Why This Combination Works:**

**Guarantee reduces financial risk:**
- "If it doesn't work, I get my money back"
- Removes downside

**Social proof reduces psychological risk:**
- "Other people like me are succeeding"
- Reduces fear of being the exception

**Together:**
- Speed = "I'll get results fast"
- Certainty = "I'm confident this will work"
- = High conversion rate

---

### The Complete Formula

**Positioning Alone (Gets Interest):**
"B2B companies: We show you how to turn 100 cold prospects into paying customers without spending thousands on ads and without relying on outside agencies."

**+ Speed (Creates Urgency):**
"...and we have you sending emails by week 2 and generating calls by week 3."

**+ Certainty (Removes Risk):**
"...guaranteed results or full refund + see live case studies of people getting results right now."

**= High Conversion Positioning**

---

## Section 6: The Exact Syntax Principle

### Why Exact Words Matter

**Fazio's Instruction:**

"You need to get it directly from the people you are selling to, and I mean the **exact syntax** and **sentence structure** that they are using."

---

### Example: The Wrong Way (Made Up Language)

**What You Might Write (Made Up):**
"Agencies struggling with client acquisition can leverage our proprietary outreach methodology to systematically generate qualified opportunities through targeted cold outreach campaigns."

**Why This Fails:**
- "Leverage our proprietary methodology" → No one talks like this
- "Systematically generate qualified opportunities" → Marketing jargon
- Sounds like a robot wrote it
- Doesn't resonate emotionally

---

### Example: The Right Way (Their Exact Words)

**What Prospects Actually Say (Captured from Calls):**

"I tried running ads and just burned through $30K with nothing to show for it. Now I'm terrified of spending more money. I can't afford to hire an agency because I don't trust them to actually give a shit about my business. I'm one bad month away from having to go get a job again and I can't let that happen."

**Your Positioning (Using Their Language):**

"Tried running ads and burned $30K with nothing to show? Tired of agencies that don't actually care about your business?

We show you how to generate 15-25 qualified calls per month **without wasting money on ads** and **without relying on agencies who don't care**."

**Why This Works:**
- "$30K burned" → Their exact number, their exact fear
- "Agencies that don't care" → Their exact complaint
- "One bad month away from a job" → Deep emotional trigger (optional to use directly)

---

### How to Capture Exact Syntax

**During Sales Calls:**
1. Record the call (with permission)
2. Transcribe it
3. Highlight phrases that indicate pain, fear, or failed attempts
4. Copy/paste into positioning document

**Example Phrases to Capture:**

**Pain Points:**
- "I'm so tired of..."
- "The worst part is..."
- "What really pisses me off is..."
- "I'm scared that..."

**Failed Attempts:**
- "I tried X but..."
- "I spent $X on Y and..."
- "I hired Z and they..."

**Desires:**
- "What I really want is..."
- "If I could just..."
- "All I need is..."

---

## Section 7: The Positioning Construction Framework

### Step 1: Collect Raw Data

**Ask these questions to 10-20 prospects/clients:**

1. What did you try before this?
2. Why didn't that work?
3. How much did you spend on that?
4. Who sold you that solution?
5. What made you realize you needed help?
6. What are you most scared of right now?
7. What happens if you don't fix this problem?
8. What would success look like to you?

**Document their answers word-for-word.**

---

### Step 2: Identify Patterns

**Look for repeated phrases:**

**Example Pattern Analysis:**

| Question | Common Answer 1 | Common Answer 2 | Common Answer 3 |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| What did you try? | Ads ($20-40K spent) | Hired agency (didn't work) | Did it myself (overwhelmed) |
| Why didn't it work? | "No qualified leads" | "Agency didn't care" | "Didn't know what I was doing" |
| What are you scared of? | "Wasting more money" | "Having to get a job" | "Business failing" |

**Frequency:**
- "Wasted money on ads" = 15/20 prospects
- "Agency didn't care" = 12/20 prospects
- "Don't know what I'm doing" = 18/20 prospects

**These become your positioning elements.**

---

### Step 3: Build the Positioning Statement

**Formula:**

```
[Target Market]: We show you how to [Desired Outcome]
without [Failed Attempt #1] and without [Failed Attempt #2].
```

**Using Example Data:**

**Target Market:** B2B agencies and consultants

**Desired Outcome:** Get 20+ qualified calls per month

**Failed Attempt #1:** Wasting money on ads (mentioned by 75%)

**Failed Attempt #2:** Hiring agencies that don't care (mentioned by 60%)

**Final Positioning:**
"B2B agencies and consultants: We show you how to get 20+ qualified calls per month without wasting money on ads and without hiring agencies that don't actually care about your results."

---

### Step 4: Layer in Speed & Certainty

**Add Speed Elements:**
"...and we have you booking calls within 14 days."

**Add Certainty Elements:**
"...guaranteed minimum of 15 calls in 90 days or full refund + see active case studies."

**Final:**
"B2B agencies and consultants: We show you how to get 20+ qualified calls per month without wasting money on ads and without hiring agencies that don't care about your results. We have you booking calls within 14 days, with a guaranteed minimum of 15 calls in 90 days or full refund."

---

## Section 8: Advanced Positioning Techniques

### Technique #1: The "Without" Framework

**Structure:**
"We help you achieve [desired outcome] without [common failed method] and without [common fear]."

**Examples:**

"Get to $30K/month without spending thousands on ads and without needing to hire expensive agencies."

"Build an email list of 10,000+ subscribers without paid ads and without complex funnel software."

"Scale to 100 employees without VC money and without losing company culture."

**Why "Without" Works:**
- Addresses failed attempts implicitly
- Removes fears and objections
- Positions you as the alternative to broken solutions

---

### Technique #2: The Exact Number Drop

**Vague (Weak):**
"We help you get more clients"

**Specific (Strong):**
"We help you get 15-25 qualified sales calls per month"

**Even More Specific (Strongest):**
"We help you turn 100 cold prospects into 15-25 qualified sales calls per month"

**Why Exact Numbers Work:**
- Can't make them up (implies real experience)
- Creates clear success metric
- Allows prospect to calculate ROI immediately
- More believable than vague claims

---

### Technique #3: The Objection Pre-Frame

**Structure:**
Address the objection BEFORE they think it.

**Example:**

**Without Pre-Frame:**
"We do cold email lead generation for you."

**Prospect Thinks:**
"But I tried cold email and it didn't work..."

**With Pre-Frame:**
"We do cold email lead generation for you - even if you've tried cold email before and couldn't get it to work. Most people fail at cold email because [specific reason], which is exactly what we fix."

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges their past failure
- Doesn't make them wrong for trying
- Positions you as the solution to why it failed
- Removes objection before it forms

---

### Technique #4: The Fear Callout

**Structure:**
Directly state the fear they have but haven't said.

**Example:**

"**Scared you'll burn another $30K on marketing that doesn't work?** We guarantee a minimum of 15 qualified calls in 90 days or you don't pay a cent."

**Why This Works:**
- Deep emotional resonance
- "Holy shit, they get me"
- Creates immediate trust
- Positions solution as the answer to the exact fear

---

## Section 9: The Positioning Testing Framework

### How to Know If Your Positioning Is Working

**Test #1: The 5-Second Test**
- Show your positioning to someone unfamiliar
- They read it for 5 seconds
- Take it away
- Ask: "What do I do and who do I help?"
- If they can't answer clearly → Your positioning is unclear

---

**Test #2: The Objection Test**
- Show positioning to 10 prospects
- Count how many ask objection questions
- If most ask "But what about X?" or "Does this work if Y?" → Your positioning doesn't address their fears

---

**Test #3: The Interest Test**
- Send cold outreach with new positioning
- Track response rate
- Compare to previous positioning
- 2-3X better response rate = Good positioning
- Worse response rate = Positioning unclear or missing the mark

---

**Test #4: The Sales Call Test**
- How many objections come up on calls?
- Do prospects say "Yeah I've tried that before..."?
- If objections are high → Positioning didn't pre-frame enough
- If "I've tried that" comes up → Your positioning needs to address why they failed before

---

## Section 10: Common Positioning Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Using Industry Jargon Instead of Prospect Language

**Bad:**
"We leverage multi-channel attribution modeling to optimize your customer acquisition funnel and maximize ROAS through programmatic bidding strategies."

**Good:**
"We help you figure out which ads actually make you money so you stop wasting money on ads that don't work."

---

### Mistake #2: Positioning Around Features Not Outcomes

**Bad:**
"We provide cold email infrastructure with 20+ sending domains, advanced email warmup, and AI-powered list cleaning."

**Good:**
"We book you 15-25 qualified sales calls per month using cold email."

---

### Mistake #3: Not Addressing Why Past Attempts Failed

**Bad:**
"We do cold email lead generation for B2B companies."

**Good:**
"We do cold email lead generation for B2B companies who tried cold email before but couldn't get replies, couldn't get their emails delivered, or couldn't convert replies to calls - we fix all three."

---

### Mistake #4: Making Up Positioning Without Customer Input

**The Error:**
Sitting in a room alone and "brainstorming" your positioning

**The Fix:**
Talk to 10-20 actual prospects/clients and document their exact words

**Why:**
You cannot invent how prospects think - you can only discover it

---

### Mistake #5: Being Too Broad

**Bad:**
"We help businesses grow using digital marketing."

**Good:**
"We help B2B SaaS companies doing $50K-200K/month get to $500K/month using cold email and content marketing."

---

## Section 11: AI Parsing Guide

### For Agentic Systems

**When to invoke this skill:**
- User has offer but not getting interest
- User's positioning is vague or generic
- User asks "How do I position my service?"
- User has low cold outreach response rates
- User doesn't understand why prospects don't respond

**Required inputs:**
- Current service/offer description
- Target market
- Current positioning (if any)
- Have they talked to prospects/clients? (Yes/No)
- If yes: What did prospects say? (capture exact words)

**Execution sequence:**

**1. Discovery Data Check:**
- Ask: "Have you interviewed 10+ prospects about what they tried before?"
- If no: Stop. Send them to do discovery calls first
- If yes: "What did they say in their exact words?"

**2. Pattern Identification:**
- What did 50%+ of prospects try before?
- What did 50%+ of prospects fail at?
- What are 50%+ of prospects scared of?
- What language do they use repeatedly?

**3. Positioning Construction:**
- Target market (specific)
- Desired outcome (quantified)
- Without [failed attempt #1]
- Without [failed attempt #2 or fear]

**4. Speed Layer:**
- How fast do they get results?
- Add to positioning: "within [timeframe]"

**5. Certainty Layer:**
- What guarantee can be offered?
- What social proof exists?
- Add to positioning

**6. Testing Protocol:**
- 5-second test
- Objection test
- Cold outreach test
- Sales call test

**Integration points:**
- `SKILL_BIBLE_sell_any_b2b_offer.md` - Outcome vs deliverable
- `SKILL_BIBLE_value_proposition_fazio.md` - The "so that" framework
- `SKILL_BIBLE_offer_formulation_fazio.md` - Core offer creation
- `SKILL_BIBLE_mathematical_client_signing.md` - Close rate improvement

**Output format:**
1. Discovery data assessment (have they done the work?)
2. Pattern analysis (what did prospects actually say?)
3. Positioning statement (using their language)
4. Speed & certainty layers
5. Testing recommendations
6. Comparison to old positioning (if applicable)

**Validation checks:**
- [ ] Is positioning using prospect's exact language (not made up)?
- [ ] Does it address what they tried and failed?
- [ ] Does it address their stated fears?
- [ ] Is the outcome quantified?
- [ ] Is target market specific?
- [ ] Does it pass the 5-second test?
