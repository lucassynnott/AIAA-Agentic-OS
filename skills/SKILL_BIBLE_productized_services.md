## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Custom services are hard to sell and hard to scale. Productized services have clear scope, fixed pricing, and repeatable delivery.

**Service vs Product**:
- Service: "It depends" pricing, custom scope
- Product: Fixed price, defined deliverable

**Why Productize**:
- Easier to sell
- Easier to deliver
- Easier to scale
- Higher margins

## 2. PRODUCTIZATION FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Identify the Core

What do you deliver most often?
- What do 80% of clients need?
- What can you systematize?
- What has clear outcomes?

### Step 2: Define the Deliverable

Make it tangible:
- Specific outputs
- Clear timeline
- Measurable result

### Step 3: Standardize Process

Create repeatable delivery:
- SOPs for each step
- Templates and tools
- Quality checkpoints

### Step 4: Set Fixed Pricing

Price for value, not time:
- Calculate value delivered
- Set price at 10-20% of value
- One price, no negotiation

### Step 5: Name It

Create proprietary positioning:
- "The [X] System"
- "[Result] in [Timeframe]"
- Unique, memorable name

## 3. PRODUCTIZATION EXAMPLES

### Before: Custom Service

"We do marketing consulting. Price depends on scope."

### After: Productized Service

"The 90-Day Lead System: We build and launch a cold email system that generates 30+ qualified leads per month. $5,000 setup + $2,000/month management."

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Custom | Productized |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Scope | Negotiated | Fixed |
| Price | Variable | Set |
| Delivery | Ad hoc | Systematized |
| Selling | Complex | Simple |
