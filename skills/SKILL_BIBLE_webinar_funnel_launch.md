## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Webinars are a lump-sum funnel—you front cash, promote for 1-2 weeks, and get a spike of revenue in 72 hours to 5 days. Higher risk than daily lead flow funnels, but massive scale potential once dialed in.

**The Webinar Reality**:
```
Webinars are math + skill.
You need enough registrants to survive show rates, retention, and conversion rates.
And you need to be GOOD at group selling.
```

**When to Use Webinars**:
- High-ticket products/services ($3K-$70K+)
- You can present well (or will learn)
- You have capital to risk ($20K+ per webinar)
- You want a scalable acquisition channel

## 2. THE THREE AUDIENCE TYPES

### Organic Audience (Lowest Risk)

**Who**: People who already follow you, on your email list, engaged with your content

**Characteristics**:
- Know, like, and trust you
- More forgiving of mistakes
- Higher show rates (30-40%)
- Limited scale (finite audience)
- No ad spend required

**Best For**: First webinar launch, testing offer, building proof

### Warm Paid Advertising (Medium Risk)

**Who**: Retargeting audiences—website visitors, email list, social engagers, video viewers

**Characteristics**:
- Some familiarity with you
- Moderate show rates (20-30%)
- Larger than organic, still limited
- Requires ad spend
- More forgiving than cold

**Best For**: Second phase, accumulating house money

### Cold Paid Advertising (Highest Risk, Highest Scale)

**Who**: People who have never heard of you

**Characteristics**:
- Highly judgmental
- Razor-thin tolerance for BS
- Low show rates (10-15%)
- Unlimited scale potential
- Requires significant ad spend

**Best For**: Scale phase AFTER dialing in webinar

## 3. THE HOUSE MONEY STRATEGY

### The Concept

Don't go straight to cold paid advertising. Accumulate "house money" from easier audiences first, then use that money to survive the cold audience burn phase.

### The Path to Profitability

```
PHASE 1: Organic/Warm (Get Profitable)
├── Lower risk
├── Higher show rates
├── Accumulate cash
└── Test and refine webinar

PHASE 2: Cold Paid (Burn Phase)
├── High risk
├── Low show rates
├── Use house money to survive
└── Iterate until dialed in

PHASE 3: Scale (Profitable Cold)
├── Webinar is optimized
├── Cold audience converts
├── Scale budget aggressively
└── $1M/month potential
```

## 4. WEBINAR MATH

### The Financial Model

**Example: $20K Budget, $20 CPL, $10K Offer**

```
$20,000 budget ÷ $20 CPL = 1,000 registrants

1,000 registrants
× 10% show rate (cold) = 100 live attendees
× 70% stay for pitch = 70 during pitch
× 20% book call = 14 calls
× 50% call show rate = 7 sales calls
× 30% close rate = 2.1 sales

2 sales × $10,000 = $20,000 revenue

Break even.
```

**The Lesson**: At conservative stats, you need high ACV to make cold webinars work.

### Variables to Optimize

| Variable | Poor | Average | Good | Impact |
|----------|------|---------|------|--------|
| CPL | $30+ | $20-25 | $15-20 | More registrants per $ |
| Show Rate | <10% | 10-15% | 15-20%+ | More live attendees |
| Retention | <60% | 60-70% | 70-80%+ | More people during pitch |
| Book Rate | <15% | 15-20% | 20-30%+ | More calls booked |
| Call Show | <50% | 50-60% | 60-70%+ | More actual calls |
| Close Rate | <20% | 20-30% | 30-40%+ | More sales |

### Do the Math FIRST

Before risking money, plug YOUR numbers into the model.

```
Your budget: $______
Your CPL: $______
Expected registrants: ______
Expected show rate: _____%
Expected retention: _____%
Expected book rate: _____%
Expected call show: _____%
Expected close rate: _____%
Your ACV: $______

Projected sales: ______
Projected revenue: $______

Is the risk worth it? Y/N

## 5. LAUNCH STRATEGY

### Step 1: Research First

**Go watch webinars from people crushing it**.

**Example**: Tom Cruz (Section 8 space) - Weekly webinars for 4+ years

**What to study**:
- How they open
- How they transition to pitch
- How they handle objections
- Energy and state
- Structure and timing
- Q&A approach

**Key Insight**: It doesn't have to be competitors. Learning from OTHER niches is often more valuable.

### Step 2: Start with Organic/Warm

**First webinar**: Your existing audience only
- No ad spend risk
- Higher show rates
- More forgiving
- Test your presentation

**Goal**: Get proof of concept and some house money

### Step 3: Iterate Before Scaling

**Don't scale until**:
- Webinar is dialed in
- Statistics are above break-even
- You know what works
- You've done 3-5+ webinars

### Step 4: Scale with Cold

**Only AFTER dialing in**:
- Increase budget 2-4x
- Go fully cold
- Expect worse stats initially
- Iterate until profitable
- Then scale aggressively

## 6. WEBINAR BEST PRACTICES

### Duration

**Target**: 90 minutes or less

**Breakdown**:
- Content/value: 45-50 minutes
- Pitch: 20-25 minutes
- Q&A: 15-20 minutes

**Warning**: 3-hour webinars destroy performance with affluent audiences. They don't have time.

### The Permission Close (Russell Brunson)

When transitioning to pitch:

```
"Listen, I have something I've put together that can help you 
take this further. It's a paid offer.

If it's okay with you, I'd love to spend a few minutes 
telling you about it and seeing if it makes sense for you.

If you're cool with that, just drop a 1 in the chat."

[Wait for 1s to come in]

"Awesome, seeing lots of 1s. Let me share what we've got..."
```

**Why It Works**: Gets buy-in before pitching, reduces resistance.

### State and Energy

**Your state determines performance**.

**Case Study**: Client did webinar #1 great ($40K revenue). Webinar #2, showed up in bad state, made a new deck, went 3 hours—only 1 sale.

**Lessons**:
1. Show up in the right energy state
2. Don't make dramatic changes between webinars
3. Make minor iterations, not complete overhauls
4. Keep timing consistent

### Book Call vs Direct Sale

**Rule of Thumb**:
- Under $5K: Direct checkout can work
- Over $5K: Book a call

**Why**: High-ticket purchases have personal questions people won't ask in group settings (competitors present, sensitive situations).

## 7. SHOW RATE OPTIMIZATION FOR WEBINARS

### Confirmation Page

- Main video explaining what to expect
- Breakout videos on common questions
- Urgency video (why now)
- Testimonials

### Email Sequence

**Timing**: Light at start, heavy near event

```
Days 14-10: 1-2 emails total
Days 9-5: 1 email every 2 days
Days 4-2: 2-3 emails per day
Day 1: 4-6 emails
Day of: 3-4 countdown emails
```

### Hammer Them Campaign

Content remarketing hitting registrants 15-20+ times before webinar.

### Sales Rep Outreach

Have team personally reach out to VIP registrants (larger companies, bigger budgets) before the webinar.

---

## 8. POST-WEBINAR FOLLOW-UP

### The 72-Hour Window

Most revenue comes in 72 hours after the webinar.

**Day 0 (same day)**: Replay link + scarcity
**Day 1**: Case study + deadline reminder
**Day 2**: Objection handling + final deadline
**Day 3**: Deadline expires, last chance

### Call Show Rate for Webinar Leads

**Expected**: 60-80%+ (much higher than cold call funnels)

**Why**: They showed up live, engaged, raised hand—much warmer.

## 9. THE BURN PHASE SURVIVAL GUIDE

### What to Expect

When you go cold:
- Show rates drop
- Conversion drops
- Stats are brutal
- It feels like failure

**This is normal.** It takes 3-5+ webinars to dial in cold.

### What to Track

After each webinar, document:
- Registrants and CPL
- Show rate
- Retention by section
- Pitch conversion
- Call booking rate
- Call show rate
- Close rate

### What to Iterate

**High Impact**:
1. Webinar content/messaging
2. Show rate optimization
3. Sales team talk tracks

**Medium Impact**:
4. Landing page
5. Ad creative
6. Follow-up sequences

### When to Scale

**Signs you're ready**:
- Consistent above break-even
- 3+ webinars with similar stats
- Know what's working
- Have the capital to 4x budget
