## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

80% of sales require 5+ touchpoints. Most people give up after 1-2. Systematic follow-up is the difference between winning and losing.

**The Follow-Up Truth**: Persistence wins. But persistence with value, not annoyance.

**The Context Principle** (Jeremy Haynes):
```
Context = Big Dollars

When you treat everybody the same going through your sales process,
you're going to have a bad time. You're not going to maximize every lead.
```

**Follow-Up Equation**:
```
Conversion = (Value Per Touch × Number of Touches × Channel Variety × Context) / Annoyance Factor
```

## 2. FOLLOW-UP PRINCIPLES

### Each Touch Must Add Value

**Don't**: "Just checking in" / "Following up"
**Do**: New information, new angle, new value

### Multi-Channel Approach

Use multiple channels:
- Email
- Phone
- SMS
- LinkedIn
- Voicemail

### Know When to Stop

- 5-7 touches for cold outreach
- Document and move on
- Circle back in 3-6 months

## 3. COLD OUTREACH FOLLOW-UP

### Sequence (7 touches)

**Day 1**: Initial email
**Day 3**: Follow-up email (new angle)
**Day 5**: Phone + voicemail
**Day 7**: Email (case study)
**Day 10**: LinkedIn connection/message
**Day 14**: Email (direct ask)
**Day 21**: Breakup email

### Follow-Up Email Templates

Wanted to share something I thought you'd find interesting: [relevant insight or case study].

[Brief connection to their situation]

```

```

**Day 14 - Direct**:
```
Subject: Quick question

[Name],

I've sent a few notes but haven't heard back. Totally understand you're busy.

Just want to know: is [pain point] something you're actively trying to solve, or should I check back another time?

Either way works—just want to make sure I'm not cluttering your inbox.
```

**Day 21 - Breakup**:
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

[Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm going to assume the timing isn't right.

I'll close out our conversation for now—but if [problem] becomes a priority, feel free to reach out.

Wishing you all the best with [their business/goal].

## 8. CRM DISSERTATION SYSTEM (Jeremy Haynes)

### The Problem

Salespeople complain leads are "unqualified" when really they're just too early in the sales process. Instead of throwing leads away, deploy contextual follow-up based on WHERE they are.

### How It Works

```
1. Salesperson talks to lead
2. Marks a "dissertation reason" in CRM dropdown
3. That triggers specific follow-up sequence
4. Lead gets contextual content for their situation
5. Higher probability of converting on follow-up
```

### Dissertation Reasons (CRM Dropdowns)

| Reason | Meaning | Follow-Up Approach |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Too Early | Not ready to buy yet | Educational sequence |
| Needs [X] Framing | Missing understanding of component | Targeted content on that topic |
| Price Objection | Cost concern | Value/ROI focused content |
| Timing Objection | Not now | Nurture sequence + check back |
| Competitor | Evaluating others | Differentiation content |
| Authority | Needs approval | Materials for stakeholders |
| Specific Objection | Named concern | Dedicated objection content |

### Marketing Automation Triggers

**For Each Dissertation Reason, Create**:
1. Email sequence (3-6 emails on that topic)
2. SMS sequence (2-3 texts)
3. Content remarketing sequence (Hammer Them)
4. Salesperson follow-up talk track

### Consumables Library

**Every dissertation reason needs consumables**:
- Videos (short + long form)
- Written content (emails, docs)
- Gamma presentations
- Sales assets (one-pagers)
- Salesperson scripts

### The Daniel Fazio Tip

Add chapter titles to your VSLs and long-form content, just like YouTube videos.

**Why**: People scrub through content. Let them find what's relevant to them. Increases retention dramatically.

**Format**:
```
0:00 - Introduction
2:30 - [Topic 1]
5:00 - [Topic 2]
8:00 - [Topic 3]
...
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Audit your CRM**: What fields exist for lead status?
2. **Survey sales team**: What are the real reasons people don't close?
3. **Create dissertation reasons**: 5-10 specific categories
4. **Build consumables**: Videos, emails, assets for each
5. **Set up automation**: If [reason] then [sequence]
6. **Train salespeople**: How to mark and use the system

### Case Study

**Before System**:
- "Unqualified leads" thrown away
- Generic follow-up sequence for everyone
- Low recovery rate on lost deals

**After System**:
- 5-10% lift in close rates from follow-up
- Sales team has contextual resources
- Leads get relevant content
- Recovery rate on "lost" deals increased significantly
