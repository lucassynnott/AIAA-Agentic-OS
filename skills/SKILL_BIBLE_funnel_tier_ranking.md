## S TIER: Primary Money Makers

### 1. Call Funnels ⭐

**Ranking:** S Tier (Absolute top)

**Structure:**
```
Direct Response Ad → VSL Page + Application → Book Call → Sales Call → Close
```

**Why S Tier:**
- Works majority of the time
- Go-to strategy for any new business
- When optimized with backend systems, crushes consistently
- Especially effective for high-ticket

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Hammer Them content remarketing
- Breakout videos on confirmation page
- Value dense email sequences
- Setter manual outreach
- Trust assets for salespeople

> "If you fail to make call funnels work, it's typically because you have an awful show rate and are failing to implement modern best practices."

---

### 2. Live Webinars ⭐

**Ranking:** S Tier (Resurrected from A Tier)

**Why Upgraded:**
- Were A Tier during "dark ages" of last several years
- Now absolutely crushing again
- Short-form content changed consumption patterns
- Live format builds trust that automated can't replicate

**Key Insight:**
> "Up to one-third of high-ticket buyers watch more than one webinar before buying. When they return for auto-webinar and see it's the same, they don't buy."

**Best Practice:**
- Execute live at high frequency
- Target cold audiences with live webinars
- Different best practices than old webinars
- Combine with call booking (not just direct checkout)

---

### 3. Challenge Funnels ⭐

**Ranking:** S Tier (Borderline A)

**Why S Tier:**
- Lump sums are "generational"
- Case study: $292K spend → $3.4M revenue + $600K tickets

**Why Almost A Tier:**
1. **Exhaustive workload** - Not light work
2. **Expensive production** - $90-120K for high-end virtual studios
3. **Can't sustain frequency** - Most do 1-2x/year max
4. **Requires promotional runway** - 60+ day cycles ideal

**The Frequency Problem:**
> "If you only gave yourself 30 days, you probably wouldn't have time to fix what's not working."

**Smaller Scale Example:**
- Inner circle member spent $7K
- Made $200K (mostly organic push)
- Still excellent ROI at smaller risk

---

## A TIER: Strong Contributors

### 4. Book Funnels

**Ranking:** A Tier (Borderline B)

**Why A Tier:**
- When run, works majority of the time
- Becomes cornerstone funnel when dialed in
- Great for liquidating ad spend

**Case Study:**
- $43K spend in May
- $322K from upsells
- 7% conversion to $12K AOV upsell

**Limitations:**
- Minority of businesses willing to execute
- Not applicable to all business types
- Requires right offer structure

> "Does a wardrobe service selling $35K-$250K packages need a book funnel? Probably not."

---

### 5. Live Events

**Ranking:** A Tier

**Lump Sum Potential:**
- One client: $19 million from single joint live event
- Inner circle member: Monthly events clearing million-dollar months

**Why Not S Tier:**
1. Even more exhausting than challenge funnels
2. 3-6 months coordination required
3. Requires one-to-many presentation skills
4. Inconsistent due to infrequency

> "Not for the weak, not for newbies, not for novices. Very skilled funnel."

---

### 6. Low-Ticket to High-Ticket

**Ranking:** A Tier (Borderline B)

**Why A Tier:**
- Consistent performance when done right
- Great for liquidating ad spend
- Increases overall ROAS when blended

**Why People Fail:**
> "They make up random shit to sell low ticket that has no congruency to the high ticket thing."

**Success Requirements:**
- Low-ticket from main product (broken branch)
- Immediate high-impact result
- Fast consumption = fast ascension

---

### 7. DM Ads

**Ranking:** A Tier (Borderline B)

**The Ceiling Problem:**
> "Number one funnel type I see with hard ceiling around $200-300K/month."

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Platform restrictions (7-day rule, 24-hour rule)
- Account shutdowns (one member restricted 3 months)
- Setter inconsistency
- Tech limitations

**Bright Spot:**
- AI tools like BB9 replicating setters
- Can be more consistent than humans
- Good for "chunk method" contribution

---

## B TIER: Situational Performers

### 8. Auto Webinars

**Ranking:** B Tier (Downgraded from historical performance)

**Why Downgraded:**
- Not working well anymore
- 1/3 of buyers watch multiple webinars
- Returning viewers realize it's not live
- Trust erosion compared to live

**Exception:**
- Hybrid model: Live intro, auto for 90%, live moderation in chat
- Still not technically "automated"

---

### 9. Quiz Funnels

**Ranking:** B Tier

**When They Work:**
- Suite of offers to route people to
- Questions that genuinely frame the sale
- Right type of product/service

**When They Don't:**
- Just feels like application funnel
- No real product diversity
- Questions don't create frame

> "Not S tier, not A tier. For right businesses, awesome. For majority, just not going to do what it's chalked up to do."

---

### 10. IG Shoutouts

**Ranking:** B Tier

**The Reality:**
- One person dominates: Jeremy Moser
- Competitors learned from him, don't execute as well
- When it works: S tier results
- When it doesn't: Couple hundred K contribution max

> "If just judged on Jeremy Moser, definitely S tier. But majority of the time when run by others, not working."

---

### 11. Lead Forms (Hydra Strategy)

**Ranking:** B Tier

**Why B Despite Being Excellent:**
- Requires "real salespeople" (not fat cat closers)
- Must have team that chases, dials, follows up relentlessly
- Most sales teams don't qualify

**When It Works:**
- In-platform applications with conditional logic
- Route qualified leads, drop unqualified
- Phenomenal statistics

> "I would love to rank it higher as creator of the Hydra, but minority of the time are we able to deploy it."

---

## C TIER: Largely Dead

### 12. Lead Magnets

**Ranking:** C Tier

**Why C Tier:**
- Point of friction for rich demographics
- Why opt-in for free thing if selling high-ticket?
- Low activation and consumption rates
- Sabotages high-ticket sale if not consumed

> "Kind of a funnel that's died. Not nearly as used or effective as it once was."

**When Still Works:**
- Right lead magnet
- Fast consumption
- High activation
- Doesn't sabotage high-ticket

---

### 13. Mini Courses / Trust Funnels

**Ranking:** C Tier

**The Attrition Problem:**
- Waterfall effect: Lose people at each step
- Low retention per video
- Most won't refilm when video underperforms

**Why It Fails:**
> "That video is fucking up the entire chain of people getting to the other side. Let me go refilm? Just not a lot of willingness to do that."

**Bright Spot:**
- AI tools like Descript for quick edits
- Can retype words, regenerate speech
- Still rarely executed

---

## D TIER: Never Try

**Nothing currently ranked D Tier** - Jeremy doesn't expose himself to consistently failing strategies.

---

## The Chunk Method

**Definition:** Using multiple A/B tier funnels together to hit million-dollar months

**Example Mix:**
- Call funnels (primary)
- Live webinars (periodic)
- Challenge funnels (1-2x/year)
- Low-ticket to high-ticket (ongoing)
- DM ads (supplementary)

> "Not just one channel makes all the revenue, but several channels make up the total revenue."

---

## Decision Framework

### For New Business Launch
1. Start with **Call Funnels** (S tier, fastest to validate)
2. Add **Live Webinars** when ready for volume
3. Test **Challenge Funnel** 1-2x/year for lump sums

### For Scaling Past $500K/Month
1. Implement **Chunk Method**
2. Add **Low-Ticket to High-Ticket** to liquidate spend
3. Consider **Book Funnel** if applicable
4. **Live Events** 2-4x/year

### For Maximum Lump Sums
1. **Challenge Funnels** - Highest ROI potential
2. **Live Events** - Largest single-event numbers
3. **Live Webinars** - Consistent weekly/monthly lumps
