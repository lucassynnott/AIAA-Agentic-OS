## Pre-Onboarding Preparation

### Why Onboarding is Critical

**The Data:**
- Proper onboarding reduces churn by 30-47%
- First 30 days determine if client stays or leaves
- 70% of clients who see results in first 30 days stay 12+ months
- Poor onboarding is the #1 reason for early churn

**Core Principle:**
The onboarding process is where you deliver on the promise you made during the sales call. This is where trust is built or broken.

## Retention-Focused Onboarding

### The Retention Mindset

**Core Principle:**
Client retention starts from day one. Everything in onboarding should be designed to:
1. Demonstrate value quickly
2. Build trust consistently
3. Set realistic expectations
4. Create positive momentum
5. Establish strong relationship

### Red Flags to Watch For

**During Onboarding Process:**

🚩 **Client doesn't complete onboarding form**
- Action: Personal outreach to understand why
- Follow-up: Offer to complete over phone call
- Escalation: May indicate lack of commitment

🚩 **Client misses or reschedules onboarding call multiple times**
- Action: Gauge actual level of interest
- Consider: May not be right time for them
- Option: Offer to pause start date

🚩 **Client has unclear or unrealistic goals**
- Action: Invest extra time in goals clarification
- Required: Reset expectations before proceeding
- Document: Ensure agreement on realistic outcomes

🚩 **Client is unresponsive to requests for access/materials**
- Action: Make it as easy as possible
- Provide: Step-by-step instructions
- Offer: To do it for them (if appropriate)
- Timeline: Set firm deadline and consequences

🚩 **Client questions process or methodology repeatedly**
- Action: More thorough explanation needed
- Consider: May not be right fit
- Address: Underlying concerns about investment

🚩 **Client mentions previous bad experiences**
- Action: Understand what went wrong
- Reassure: Explain how you're different
- Document: Their concerns to avoid same issues

**During First 30 Days:**

🚩 **Client is difficult to reach or unresponsive**
- Action: Try multiple communication channels
- Discuss: Their preferred communication style
- Consider: May not have time to be good client

🚩 **Client doesn't review or approve deliverables timely**
- Action: Simplify approval process
- Make easier: Provide specific yes/no questions
- Set: Clear deadlines with consequences

🚩 **Client requests frequent scope changes**
- Action: Document all changes clearly
- Discuss: Impact on timeline and costs
- May need: Scope change agreement

🚩 **Client focuses only on negatives, ignores wins**
- Action: Proactively highlight wins
- Discuss: Perspective and expectations
- Consider: May never be satisfied

🚩 **Client doesn't implement recommendations**
- Action: Understand barriers to implementation
- Offer: More hands-on support
- Discuss: Whether continued engagement makes sense
