# SKILL BIBLE: Twitter/X Masterclass (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents Daniel Fazio's complete Twitter growth and monetization system—91,000 followers and $3M+ in direct revenue. The key insight: Twitter has intelligent people (unlike Instagram's "flexi" culture). If you have interesting things to say, you can build massive leverage. The system progresses through engagement phases, leverages automation tools, and converts followers into revenue.

**Key Quote:** "I have made roughly just over three million dollars from Twitter. It is an integral part of our lead generation for all of our companies."

## Section 1: The Twitter Paradigm

### Why Twitter vs Other Platforms

**Twitter attracts:**
- More intelligent audience
- People interested in ideas/takes
- Those who don't want to fake Lamborghinis
- Real entrepreneurs and decision-makers

**Instagram attracts:**
- Flexing culture
- More visual/lifestyle
- Less reading-focused

### The Fundamental Rule

"The function of social media is to be social and make friends with people."

No formula will help if you:
- Don't say anything interesting
- Don't provide value
- Don't teach people things
- Haven't done anything in the real world

**The journey IS content:** "The person on the journey is equally as interesting as the person who has already completed it."

## Section 3: Cardinal Rules

### Rule 1: Tweets Don't Drive Early Growth

"If you have below a thousand followers, tweeting more will not get you more followers because there's nobody to see your tweets."

**Below 1K:** Focus on outbound comments
**Above 1K:** Tweet quantity becomes increasingly important

### Rule 2: Respond to Everything

"Responding to all comments on your tweets pushes your tweet back onto the timeline of your followers who are actively on Twitter."

This:
- Doubles comment count automatically
- Keeps tweet circulating
- Starts conversations under posts
- Pushes content farther

### Rule 3: Quality Comments Only

Don't reword what someone already said. Instead:
- Inject your own anecdotes
- Add your own experience
- Build on what they said
- Add something to the conversation

**Goal:** Comments that invoke conversation.

## Section 4: Profile Optimization

### The Follow Conversion Rate

```
Follow Conversion Rate = Profile Visits ÷ New Followers
```

Track at: analytics.twitter.com

### Bio Requirements (3 Things)

1. **State what your account is about**
2. **State any credibility you have**
3. **Call to action**

**Interesting finding:** "More people follow you if you sell something. Having something for sale automatically invokes credibility."

### Pinned Tweet Options

**Option A:** Extremely valuable thread (step-by-step how-to)
**Option B:** Direct link to your offer

**Rule:** Every profile visit is an opportunity. Maximize conversion or everything else is a waste.

---

## Section 5: Tweet Types

### 1. Competence Tweets (65%)

Shows you know what you're talking about.

**Types:**
- Testimonials (quote tweet client results)
- Case studies (thread format)
- Proof of skill ("Did X in Y days")
- Achievements/humble flexes

### 2. Engagement Tweets (15%)

Function: Gather attention.

**Warning:** If you ONLY post engagement tweets, you attract an audience that only likes engagement tweets and doesn't buy.

### 3. Sales Tweets (20%)

Direct calls to action pointing somewhere.

**Examples:**
- "One last spot open for..."
- "If you want X, go here..."
- "We guarantee X, link in bio"

## Section 8: Buying Retweets

### The Economics (When Small)

"In November 2020, I was paying $6K/month for retweets."

**Approximate rates:**
- 40K follower account retweet: ~$35
- Batches of 30: $750-$1,500

### Rules

1. Send screenshots (not links) via Telegram
2. Space retweets out
3. Twitter can't see the source

### Access

**There is no marketplace.** You must:
- Actively interact with larger accounts
- Put out good content consistently
- Build real relationships
- Ask people you actually know

**Nobody sells retweets to randoms** with bad content.

---

## Section 9: DMs Are Content Research

### The 70-90% Rule

"70-90% of your DMs will be people asking questions about the content you posted."

**This IS your content strategy:**
- Questions people ask = content people want
- You can't find this with DMs closed
- You can't find this without responding

### Relationship Building

"Someone sends me a message and I have 91,000 followers and I respond to them, they're like 'Oh, I didn't know you would respond.' I'm like, 'Yeah bro, I respond to like everything.'"

---

## Section 10: Monetization

### The Purpose

"Why are you trying to grow a social media audience if you're not selling something? There's literally no purpose to be on social media unless you're selling something."

### If Product Figured Out

1. Point to landing page
2. Plug link in ~80% of tweets
3. Retweet plug tweet 3-4 times over 3-4 days

### If Product NOT Figured Out

1. Point to follow
2. "If you liked this, follow for more"
3. Build audience first

### Two-Offer Strategy

**When you have multiple offers:**
- One for beginners (entry)
- One for established (scale)

Both links go in description. Self-sorting happens automatically.

---

## Section 11: Content Recycling

### Reword Your Own Tweets

After 3+ months, your best tweets can be reworded and reposted.

**Process:**
1. Go to Twitter advanced search
2. Search your username with min_faves:300
3. Find winning tweets from 3+ months ago
4. Reword and repost

### Reword Others' Big Ideas

**Not copying—extracting big ideas.**

**Process:**
1. Find high-performing tweet
2. Identify the "big idea"
3. Reword in your voice
4. Post as original

**Example big idea:** "Complaining is shouting to the world that you're weak"

Reworded: "The amount of problems in history solved by complaining: zero"
