# SKILL BIBLE: AI Consulting 2026 Playbook ($0 to $25K/month)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the complete step-by-step playbook to build an AI consulting business from $0 to $25,000/month and beyond. It covers the five pillars of an AI consulting agency: Marketing, Sales, Onboarding, Fulfillment, and Retention—in the order a lead flows through your business.

**Core Insight:** "If you're at $0 in revenue and you're spending literally any of your time on anything that is not just directly generating leads, you are, as a rule, wasting money."

Based on scaling two agencies to $160K/month combined revenue and teaching 6,000+ people, many of whom have closed deals worth up to $60,000 upfront.

## 1. Marketing: The Four Mechanisms That Work

### The Brutal Truth
"If you don't have leads, you don't have a business, you barely even have a hobby."

At $0 revenue, marketing is the ONLY thing that matters. Stop procrastinating.

### Marketing Method Comparison

| Method | Time Investment | Capital Required | Barrier to Entry | Scalability |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Platform Sales | High | Very Low | Low | Low |
| Cold Email | Low (after setup) | Medium | Very High | Very High |
| Communities | Very High | Very Low | Low | Medium |
| Cold DMs | High | Low | High | Medium |

---

## 2. Platform Sales (Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer)

### Why Start Here
You skip the entire buying ladder:
- ❌ Gain attention
- ❌ Convince them they have a problem
- ❌ Convince them there's a solution
- ❌ Convince them you're the right fit
- ✅ Talk to buyers with money in hand who already decided

### Career Value
Nick made $500,000+ directly from Upwork alone.

### What Makes You Win

**1. Your CV Must Pop**
- Stand out from hundreds of proposals
- Use templates designed for high conversion

**2. Custom Videos/Assets**
- Create personalized proposals
- Show you did your homework
- Demonstrate immediate value

### The Trade-Off
Least scalable (direct time investment required) but lowest barrier and fastest to first dollar.

---

## 3. Cold Email

### The Setup
- Low ongoing time (after initial setup)
- Medium upfront cost
- Very high barrier to entry (deep skills required)
- Highest scalability

### Why It's a Money Printer
"You can send 20 emails a day or 2,000 emails a day with literally the exact same system."

Once you learn the skills:
- Infrastructure setup
- Copy that converts
- Deliverability management
- Reply handling

It scales independent of your time.

### The Formula Structure
From Instantly (cold email platform):

```
1. Personalization
2. Value Prop
3. Their Niche
4. Their Goal
5. Relevant Case Study
6. Cliffhanger
7. CTA (Call to Action)
```

### Example Cold Email
```
Hey Sarah,

I've been seeing XYZ Wellness everywhere recently. Huge work.

I help health companies automate their onboarding and reduce churn with a $15,000/month minimum guarantee.

Just helped a supplement company add 32K in revenue in one month.

Can I show you how I do the same for you? No strings.
```

**What makes this work**:
- Short and specific
- No fluff, no begging
- Shows homework done
- Clear value prop
- Proof included
- Open-ended question

### Expectation Setting
"Your first campaign's probably going to be your worst."

Have runway and perseverance to iterate.

---

## 4. Communities (Slack, School, Reddit)

### The Approach
- Very high time outlay
- Very low cost
- Low barrier to entry
- Medium results

### The Objective
Build authority → Become the go-to person for a subject

### The Fishing Analogy
"Like fishing in Runescape—very slow to start. When you get to a high level, you become super valuable because you can fish swordfish."

### How to Execute
1. Filter community by questions
2. Create content calendar solving each question
3. Post consistently (daily or every 2-3 days)
4. Reply guy in comments
5. DM people who engage with your content
6. Be present 24/7

### The Relationship Multiplier
Community relationships grow far past initial expectations—partnerships, referrals, deals.

---

## 5. Cold DMs (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Facebook)

### The Setup
- High time commitment
- Low capital (platforms are free)
- High barrier to entry
- Variable results (niche/offer dependent)

### What Doesn't Work
Copy-paste templates to random founders = ghosted

### What Works
- Precise, hyperpersonalized messages
- Messages that SEEM customized (even if templated)
- Informal tone (not too formal, not lazy)
- Consistent volume over time

### Real Result
Julian from Maker School: $15,000/month from predominantly LinkedIn outreach.

### Example Cold DM
Same structure as cold email but adapted for platform:
```
Hey Sarah,

Seeing XYZ Wellness everywhere. Huge work.

I help health companies automate onboarding and reduce churn. $15K/month minimum guarantee.

Just helped a supplement company add 32K revenue in one month.

Can I show you how? No strings.
```

## 6. Sales: The Structure That Closes $60K Deals

### The Mindset Shift
"Sales is not about tricking people. It's about uncovering their pain, showing how your solution solves that pain, and positioning yourself as the obvious investment."

### The 30-45 Minute Structure

```
1. Build Rapport (1-2 min)
2. Set the Schedule (1-2 min)
3. Discovery (15-20 min)
4. Propose Solutions (5-10 min)
5. Frame Investment (5 min)
6. Send Proposal (after call)
```

---

## 7. Sales Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Rapport
**Goal**: Get them to smile

Methods:
- Light joke
- Compliment
- "Where are you based?"
- "No way, I love that city!"

Takes ~10 seconds. Then transition: "All right, ready to jump in?"

### Step 2: Set the Schedule
Take control. Show you have a process.

**Script**:
```
"Here's how these calls usually go. First, I want to understand why you booked. Then I want to dig a little deeper into your business, maybe chat some numbers. Then finally, if I think we can help, I'll show you what that looks like and we'll talk about next steps. Does that sound good?"
```

### Step 3: Discovery (Most Important)
Ask questions. They give you ammunition to close.

**High-ROI Questions**:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "Why did you decide to book the call?" | Highest ROI question ever—tells you exactly what resonated |
| "What is the goal right now?" | Gives you north star to frame everything toward |
| "Assuming we fix this, what will it do to the company?" | They tell you the value (30K savings, fire 3 people, etc.) |
| "Why haven't you done this yet?" | Reveals blockers and urgency |

**Key**: Ask follow-ups. "Oh, so how much is a client paying when they get in the door?"

### Step 4: Propose Solutions
Position your system as logical solution to their stated pain.

**Script**:
```
"We've solved many similar problems before, and this is a great fit for our system. We're going to solve X by doing Y. My hope is it will save you Z dollars every month. Would you like to see an example of how this works?"
```

Then demo from your system library (5-10 pre-built systems you can show).

**Bonus**: You're showing systems you have templates for → delivery is just duplicate + customize.

### Step 5: Frame Investment
Always do this LAST (after building value).

**Script**:
```
"Based on what you told me—to save you that $50,000 price tag—our project would cost 19 grand. Assuming there's nothing else we need to add on, your investment would pay for itself in literally the first month."
```

**Two Rules**:
1. Always frame as "investment" (not cost/price)
2. After you drop the price, SHUT UP

"First person to speak loses."

### Step 6: Handle Objections

**If they want cheaper**:
Don't just discount. Remove line items/functionality instead.
Forces them to decide what they value most + gives you more info.

**If "I need to think about it"**:
That's almost never the real reason.

Ask: "Would this system solve the needs you put in front of me?"
- If no → Now you have the real objection
- If yes → Send proposal and move on

**If they won't decide on call**:
That's okay. We're consultants, not high-pressure car salespeople.

Send detailed proposal with automatic follow-ups.

## 8. Onboarding: The 30-Minute Kickoff

### Why Onboarding Matters
Sets tone for entire relationship. Get it wrong = endless headaches and zero upsells.

### The Kickoff Structure

```
1. Introduction & Framing (1 min)
2. Goals & Timelines (5 min)
3. Communication Expectations (3 min)
4. Platform Access & 2FA (15-20 min)
5. Wrap-up (1 min)
```

### Step 1: Introduction
Thank them for joining. Set the frame:

**Script**:
```
"My goal by the end of this call—I want our company to have everything we need so we don't have to bother you or ask for permissions every day for the next week.

The biggest issue in the space is logistics. Two-factor authentication codes, passwords, access. These can be a nightmare if you let them drag out.

So instead of chasing these for weeks, I just want to handle it live on this call. I also want to cover timelines, how we're going to communicate, then walk through any platforms you need to sign up for. Does that sound good?"
```

### Step 2: Goals & Timelines
Lay out exactly what happens:

**Script**:
```
"Our goal is to start today and wrap up within 3 weeks. Obviously, if we can deliver earlier, we will.

The project will be split into three clear milestones so you always know where things stand. Here's how they work..."
```

Clients love this. Most consultants disappear into a black hole.

### Step 3: Communication Expectations
**Script**:
```
"You'll get one daily update Monday to Friday over Slack. It'll include where the project's at, what's coming next, and if I have any blockers I need you to help me with.

If you have any one-off questions, I'm going to batch them and cover them in that daily check-in. Does that work for you?"
```

This one move saves 90% of back-and-forth chaos.

### Step 4: Platform Access (Do It LIVE)
Don't send a list and wait weeks.

**Script**:
```
"Today we need admin access to your Slack and admin access to your Sanity. Let's set both up right now.

If a two-factor authentication code pops up, I'll just have you read it to me and we can proceed. We can get all this done in the next 3 minutes. Sound cool?"
```

**Why live access matters**:
- What takes 20 emails back-and-forth → 3 minutes on call
- Client signs up to platforms → No handoff needed later
- Everything already in their workspace

### Step 5: Wrap-up
Quick check: "Any questions?"

Confirm: "Great, let's kick this off. I'll give you your first update tomorrow."

---

## 9. Fulfillment: Delivery + Perception Management

### The Key Insight
"Fulfillment is not about delivering the system. It's about managing the perception of the engagement."

If client can't see progress → They assume no progress → They value it less.

### Two Parts of Fulfillment

**1. Communication**
Daily check-ins (60 seconds per client):

**Template**:
```
Hey [Client],

Just checking in. No action needed from your end.

✅ Just finished: [thing]
🔄 Just started: [thing]

Let you know how things are going tomorrow.

Thanks!
```

Send Monday-Friday over Slack/email.

**Result**: Massive trust. Proves professionalism. Doubles ability to upsell.

**2. Delivery**
Don't just hand over a workflow. Package it like a product.

**The Diamond Analogy**:
When you buy a diamond, they don't just give you a diamond. They put it in a box, wrap it in satin, put a bow on it, put it in a bag, attach a card.

For systems delivery:
- Record 10-15 minute Loom walkthrough
- Attach documentation
- Branded delivery email

### Delivery Email Template Structure
```
Subject: Your [System Name] Is Ready!

Hi [Client],

Great news—your [system] is complete and ready for launch.

Here's what's included:
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
- [Component 3]

📹 Walkthrough Video: [Loom link]
📄 Documentation: [Doc link]

Let me know if you have any questions!

[Your name]
```

## 10. Retention: Turning Projects into Long-Term Revenue

### The Opportunity Most Miss
"If you did great work and your client thanks you for it, the last thing you should be doing is disappearing and waiting for them to call you back."

That's hitting a home run and forgetting to run the bases.

### The Best Time to Upsell
Right after you just wowed them.
- Most excited
- Most trusting
- Reciprocity is triggered

### The Strategy: Overdeliver 5%
Don't just deliver what you promised. Go one step further.

**Example**:
"Hey, here's your Slack workflow. And while I was doing it, I noticed you had XYZ issues, so I just fixed that as well. Plus, here's some documentation."

### The Upsell Pitch
**Script**:
```
"While I was setting up your Slack system, I noticed your funnel wasn't sending SMS messages.

That's interesting because I've worked with a bunch of people that make seven, eight figures, and they all send SMS.

I'm thinking if you fix that, you might be able to add another $10-15K/month to your bottom line.

I know it's a bold ask, but would you be open to me just showing you how to do this whether or not you work with me?"
```

**What happens**:
- Reciprocity triggered (you just over-delivered)
- New problem identified (they didn't know they had)
- Value framed (specific dollar amount)
- Low-risk ask (just let me show you)

## AI PARSING GUIDE

### Primary Objective
When user asks "how do I start an AI consulting business" or "how do I get clients for automation services," guide them through the five pillars in order: Marketing → Sales → Onboarding → Fulfillment → Retention.

### Critical Decision Points

**If User Says**: "I have no clients"
**Action Sequence**:
1. Focus 100% on marketing
2. Start with platform sales (fastest to first dollar)
3. Build cold email system in parallel (highest scalability)
4. Join communities and post consistently

**If User Says**: "I can't close deals"
**Action Sequence**:
1. Review sales structure (rapport → schedule → discovery → solution → investment → proposal)
2. Check: Are they doing discovery properly?
3. Check: Are they dropping price too early?
4. Check: Are they speaking after dropping price?

### Integration Points
**Connects to**:

- `SKILL_BIBLE_900_ai_offers_tested.md` - What offers work best
- `SKILL_BIBLE_ai_service_pricing_premium.md` - Value-based pricing
- `SKILL_BIBLE_retainer_structures.md` - Recurring revenue

### Output Quality Standards
When advising on AI consulting:
1. ✅ Marketing comes first (always)
2. ✅ Sales structure is followed in order
3. ✅ Onboarding gets platform access live on call
4. ✅ Fulfillment includes daily communication
5. ✅ Retention includes overdelivery + upsell pitch

### Red Flags (Anti-Patterns)
❌ Spending time on anything but marketing at $0 revenue
❌ Skipping discovery in sales calls
❌ Dropping price at beginning of call
❌ Sending platform access requests via email (not live)
❌ Disappearing after delivery (no upsell attempt)
