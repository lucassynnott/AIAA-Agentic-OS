# SKILL BIBLE: Building $100K/Month from Scratch (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the complete system for building a $100K/month business from absolute zero—no clients, no skills, no money (just $500). Based on a live build-out with Daniel Fazio covering: learning a skill, free work, dream 100 outreach, YouTube content, cold email systems, hiring, and scaling to info products. Timeline: 9 months to $100K/month.

**Key Quote:** "I promise you I'd be at $100K/month in like 9 months doing exactly this."

## Section 1: The Starting Constraints

### Maximum Difficulty Mode

| Constraint | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Previous clients | Zero |
| Skills | None |
| Money | $500 |
| Case studies | None |
| Authority | None |

### The Offer Choice

**Recommendation:** Google/YouTube Ads Agency for E-commerce or SaaS

**Why Google Ads:**
- Less saturated than Facebook
- YouTube ads = same platform
- High-value skill
- Good for e-commerce (visual products)

---

## Section 2: Skill Acquisition (Days 1-14)

### The 14-Day Learning Sprint

**Day 1-2: Foundation**
1. Go to YouTube
2. Search "Google Ads Tutorial"
3. Watch EVERY video on first two pages
4. 1.5x speed
5. Write down all questions that arise
6. DON'T search answers yet—finish the pages first

**Day 3-7: Tree Branching**
1. Take your questions list
2. Search each question on YouTube
3. Watch 5-8 videos per question
4. Write down NEW questions that arise
5. Repeat the process

**Day 8-14: Deep Dives**
- Conversion tracking
- Google Shopping
- Discovery ads
- Retargeting
- Audience building

### The Tree Branching Concept

```
Main Topic: "Google Ads Tutorial"
           ↓
Question 1: "How to do conversion tracking?"
    ↓
Sub-question: "How do I put code in header?"
    ↓
Sub-sub-question: "What is Google Tag Manager?"
           ↓
[Eventually loops back—pieces connect]
```

**Result:** Minimally viable competence in ~14 days.

---

## Section 3: Content Creation (Days 15-28)

### The Raw Dog YouTube Strategy

**Create Loom videos answering every question you had:**
- No editing
- No fancy thumbnail
- Just screen share
- Google Doc on screen
- 1-2 videos per day
- 15-30 videos total

**Video format:**
```
Title: How to [specific thing you learned]
Content: Screen share explaining it
CTA: "If you need help with Google Ads, link in description"
```

### Landing Page Setup

**Tools (Total: ~$19/year):**
- Carrd.co ($19/year)
- Calendly (free)
- Google Meet (free)

**Page structure:**
1. Headline: "Need help with Google Ads?"
2. Subhead: Brief value prop
3. Calendly embed
4. That's it

### Basic SEO

Put these in title, description, and tags:
- "Google Ads"
- "YouTube Ads"
- Your specific topic
- "Tutorial"
- "How to"

---

## Section 4: Dream 100 Outreach (Months 1-3)

### Finding Prospects

**For e-commerce brands:**
- Scroll Instagram/TikTok for product ads
- If running Instagram ads → likely want Google ads
- Go to their website
- Find founder on LinkedIn
- Use Clean Leads chrome extension to get email
- Or find email on website

### The Service-Based Lead Magnet

**Don't ask permission—just DO the work:**

1. Open their Google Ads (if accessible) or analyze their situation
2. Create custom Loom video
3. Show exactly what you'd do for them
4. Send it with no strings attached

**Example message:**
```
Hey [Name],

I saw you're running Instagram ads for [product]. 
I put together a quick analysis of what I'd do for 
you on Google Ads—no strings attached.

[Loom link]

Let me know if you want to chat about it.
```

### The Performance Offer

**Since you have zero case studies:**
```
"I'll run your Google Ads on a 100% performance basis.
You only pay me 10% of gross profit.
(Gross profit = Revenue from ads - Ad spend)
No retainer. Zero risk for you."
```

**Timeline:** ~3 months to get 2-3 clients this way

- 5,000 leads = ~$395

### Cold Email Script

```
Hey [Name],

I'm reaching out because I've been working with 
[similar company] for the past couple months.

I've been able to get them a 6x return on ad spend 
on Google.

I'd love to see if I can do the same for you on a 
completely performance basis.

Let me know if that's interesting.

PS - I can send you a walkthrough Loom video of 
the ads manager and what I'm doing for them.
```

```

### The Flywheel

```

```

## Section 8: Hiring Protocol

### When to Hire

All three must be true:
1. You're at $10-20K/month
2. You're at 7-8/10 busy
3. You know how to do the fulfillment yourself

### The Workload Curve

```
Before hire: 7/10 busy
During training: 10/10 busy (1 month)
After training: 4/10 busy
New capacity: 3 points to reinvest
```

### First Hire Profile

- VA from Philippines/Eastern Europe/LATAM
- $4-9/hour
- Repetitive tasks only
- YOU teach them (don't hire "experts")

### The Training Reality

**Wrong thinking:** "I'll hire an expert for $4/hour"

**Reality:** Good people cost money. Cheap people need training.

**Your job:** Make them good by teaching your process.

### Scaling the Team

```
You teach Person A → They handle tasks → You have time
    ↓
You do more marketing → More clients → Hit capacity
    ↓
You tell Person A: "Train Person B to do what you do"
    ↓
Person A trains Person B → You have more time
    ↓
[Repeat to infinity]
```

## Section 9: The Three Requirements for Sales

### Why People Buy

Every purchase requires at least ONE of:

1. **Demonstration** (Display competence + give value)
2. **Proof** (Case studies showing results)
3. **Guarantee** (Risk reversal)

### If You Have None

**You will make $0.** Period.

### The Beginner Stack

Since you're starting with nothing:
- Give value via free content (demonstration)
- Work for free/performance to get proof
- Use guarantee until you have case studies

---

## Section 10: Common Objections

### "I don't want to put my face on video"

**Response:** "Grow up. What do you want? You're never going to make money if you can't get on camera. The market requires it."

### "This requires work"

**Response:** "Oh, I have to work to get money? Oh goodness."

### "What if I fail?"

**Response:** "Everything you want is on the tail end of doing stuff you don't want to do. Someone has to do it. That's why they pay."

### "What about competition?"

**Response:** "If someone has more than you, they're just better than you. They're doing something you're not. Get better."
