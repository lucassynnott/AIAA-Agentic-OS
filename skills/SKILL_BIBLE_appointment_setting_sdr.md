## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Appointment setting separates lead generation from closing. SDRs (Sales Development Reps) qualify leads and book calls, freeing closers to focus on what they do best.

**When to Add Appointment Setting**:
- You have more leads than you can handle
- Your close rate is high but volume is bottleneck
- You want to scale without personally prospecting
- Leads are coming in but not getting worked

**The SDR Equation**:
```
Calls Booked = (Leads Worked × Contact Rate × Qualification Rate × Booking Rate)
```

**Day 2**: Call + text
**Day 3**: Call + email
**Day 5**: Call + "breakup" email
**Day 7**: Final attempt

**Total**: 8-12 touchpoints over 7 days

### Lead Qualification

**Qualified = BANT**:
- **B**udget: Can afford
- **A**uthority: Decision maker
- **N**eed: Real problem to solve
- **T**imeline: Ready to act

### CRM Hygiene

**Required for Each Lead**:
