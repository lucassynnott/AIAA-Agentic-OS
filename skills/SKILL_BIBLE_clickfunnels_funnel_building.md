## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A funnel is the journey from ad to conversion. It's not just pages—it's a strategic sequence designed to move prospects from awareness to purchase.

**The Funnel Truth**: Most businesses don't have a conversion problem. They have a funnel problem.

**Core Funnel Equation**:
```
Revenue = Traffic × Landing Page CR × Sales Page CR × Checkout CR × AOV
```

**Key Insight**: Small improvements at each stage compound massively. 10% better at each of 4 stages = 46% more revenue.
