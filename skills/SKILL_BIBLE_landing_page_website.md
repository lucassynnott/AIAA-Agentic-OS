## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your landing page is where traffic becomes leads. The best ads in the world fail with a bad landing page. Conversion optimization here has massive ROI impact.

**The Landing Page Equation**:
```
Conversions = Traffic × (Message Match × Clarity × Trust × Urgency) / Friction
```

**B2B Landing Page Benchmarks**:
- Conversion rate: 15-40% (cold traffic)
- Above-fold engagement: 80%+ should see CTA
- Mobile traffic: 50-70% of visitors
- Load time: <3 seconds

**The Core Truth**: Simplicity wins. Every element must earn its place.

**Images**:

**Forms**:

- Appropriate keyboard types
- Autofill enabled

### Mobile Testing

Before launch:
- Test on actual devices (not just browser resize)
