## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

E-commerce email marketing is the highest-ROI channel for online stores. While paid ads get customers in the door, email converts browsers to buyers, increases AOV, and drives repeat purchases.

**The Business Model**: Agencies charge $2K-$10K/month to manage email for e-commerce brands. Top agencies do $300K+/month.

**The Core Revenue Formula**:
```
Email Revenue = List Size × Open Rate × Click Rate × Conversion Rate × AOV
```

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- Email should drive 25-40% of total store revenue
- Flows (automations) typically outperform campaigns 3:1 on revenue per recipient
- Target open rates: 40-60% (flows), 20-40% (campaigns)
- Target click rates: 2-5% (campaigns), 5-15% (flows)

**The Two Revenue Engines**:
1. **Flows (Automations)**: Welcome series, abandoned cart, browse abandon, post-purchase, winback
2. **Campaigns**: Promotional emails, content emails, launches, sales events

---

## 2. CORE FLOWS (THE MONEY MACHINES)

### The Flow Hierarchy

Flows are automated sequences triggered by customer behavior. These run 24/7 and generate predictable revenue.

**Priority Order for Setup**:
1. Welcome Flow (highest impact)
2. Abandoned Cart Flow
3. Browse Abandonment Flow
4. Post-Purchase Flow
5. Winback Flow
6. Site Abandonment Flow

### Flow 1: Welcome Flow

**What It Is**: Sequence of 5-10 emails sent over 7-14 days when someone joins your email list.

**Two Goals**:
1. Convert curious browsers into first-time buyers
2. Prime future customers by overcoming all objections

**Welcome Flow Structure**:

| Email # | Timing | Purpose | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate | Deliver incentive + introduce brand | Welcome, discount code, brand story hook |
| 2 | Day 1 | Brand story | Founder story, mission, why you exist |
| 3 | Day 2 | Social proof | Reviews, testimonials, UGC |
| 4 | Day 3 | Product education | Best sellers, how to use, benefits |
| 5 | Day 4 | Objection handling | FAQ, guarantee, shipping info |
| 6 | Day 5 | Urgency | Discount expiring soon |
| 7 | Day 7 | Final push | Last chance for welcome offer |
| 8 | Day 10 | Value content | Tips, how-to, lifestyle content |
| 9 | Day 14 | Soft sell | New arrivals or category spotlight |

**Key Metrics**:
- Open rate: 50-70% (email 1), 40-50% (rest)
- Click rate: 10-20%
- Flow revenue: 20-30% of total email revenue

### Flow 2: Abandoned Cart Flow

**What It Is**: Emails triggered when someone adds to cart but doesn't purchase.

**Structure**:

| Email # | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 1 hour | Reminder - "You left something behind" |
| 2 | 24 hours | Objection handling + social proof |
| 3 | 48 hours | Urgency - items selling fast |
| 4 | 72 hours | Incentive (small discount or free shipping) |

**Best Practices**:
- Show cart contents with images
- Include direct "Complete Purchase" CTA
- Don't give discount in first email (train customers to wait)
- Use dynamic content showing their actual cart items

### Flow 3: Browse Abandonment Flow

**What It Is**: Emails triggered when someone views products but doesn't add to cart.

**Trigger**: Viewed product 2+ times OR viewed for 60+ seconds, no purchase.

**Structure**:

| Email # | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 2 hours | "Still interested in [Product]?" |
| 2 | 24 hours | Social proof for viewed products |
| 3 | 48 hours | Related products / alternatives |

**Key Insight**: These are warm leads—they showed interest but need more info or the right offer.

### Flow 4: Post-Purchase Flow

**What It Is**: Emails after someone buys, focused on retention and upsells.

**Goals**:
1. Reduce buyer's remorse
2. Educate on product usage
3. Cross-sell / upsell
4. Get reviews

**Structure**:

| Email # | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate | Order confirmation + excitement |
| 2 | Day 3 | Shipping update + what to expect |
| 3 | Day 7 | How to use / get most value |
| 4 | Day 14 | Request review |
| 5 | Day 21 | Cross-sell related products |
| 6 | Day 30 | Replenishment reminder (if applicable) |

### Flow 5: Winback Flow

**What It Is**: Re-engagement sequence for customers who haven't purchased in 60-90+ days.

**Structure**:

| Email # | Timing | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 60 days | "We miss you" + what's new |
| 2 | 75 days | Special offer for returning |
| 3 | 90 days | Last chance before removal |

**Important**: After winback, move non-responders to sunset flow (gradual removal from list).

### Flow 6: Site Abandonment Flow

**What It Is**: Emails triggered when someone visits site but doesn't view specific products.

**Trigger**: Site visit, no product views, no purchase.

**Structure**: 1-2 emails featuring best sellers and popular categories.

## 3. CAMPAIGN STRATEGY

### Campaign vs Flow

| Aspect | Flows | Campaigns |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Trigger | Behavior-based | Time-based |
| Frequency | Ongoing/automated | 3-4x per week |
| Audience | Segment based on behavior | Engaged list |
| Revenue/recipient | Higher | Lower |
| Effort | Set up once | Ongoing creation |

### Campaign Frequency

**Optimal**: 3-4 campaigns per week

**Why More is Better**:
- Keeps you top of mind
- More touchpoints = more sales
- Good content ≠ annoying
- Lower unsubscribe rates than sending 1x/week (counterintuitive but true)

### Campaign Types

**1. Promotional Campaigns (40%)**
- Sales, discounts, flash sales
- New product launches
- Limited-time offers
- Holiday/seasonal promotions

**2. Content Campaigns (30%)**
- Educational content
- How-to guides
- Lifestyle content
- Behind-the-scenes

**3. Social Proof Campaigns (20%)**
- Customer stories
- Reviews/testimonials
- UGC features
- Case studies

**4. Engagement Campaigns (10%)**
- Polls/surveys
- Exclusive previews
- VIP content
- Community updates

### Campaign Calendar Framework

**Monday**: Content/educational
**Tuesday**: OFF
**Wednesday**: Promotional
**Thursday**: OFF
**Friday**: Promotional or flash sale
**Saturday**: OFF
**Sunday**: Social proof or content

## 4. SEGMENTATION MASTERY

### Why Segmentation Matters

Sending to your entire list = low engagement = deliverability death.

**The Rule**: Only send to people who want your emails.

### Key Segments (The 80/20)

These are the segments every e-commerce brand needs:

**1. X-Day Engaged Email Members**
- Definition: Opened or clicked email in past X days
- Recommended: Start with 60-day engaged
- Use: Base segment for all campaigns
- Why: Protects deliverability, higher engagement

**2. VIP Customers**
- Definition: Top 10-20% by total spend or order count
- Use: Exclusive offers, early access, premium treatment
- Why: Drive 50%+ of revenue from small segment

**3. Recent Purchasers**
- Definition: Purchased in last 30 days
- Use: Exclude from hard sells, include in cross-sells
- Why: Don't annoy recent buyers with discount offers

**4. Non-Purchasers**
- Definition: On list 30+ days, never purchased
- Use: Special first-purchase incentives
- Why: Different messaging than repeat buyers

**5. At-Risk / Churned**
- Definition: Previously active, no engagement 60-90 days
- Use: Winback campaigns
- Why: Re-engage before removing

**6. Product-Specific Segments**
- Definition: Purchased specific product/category
- Use: Related product recommendations
- Why: Highly targeted cross-sells

### Segmentation Types

**Behavioral Segmentation**:
- Email engagement (opens, clicks)
- Purchase behavior (frequency, recency, value)
- Browse behavior (products viewed, categories)
- Cart behavior (abandonment patterns)

**Demographic Segmentation**:
- Location (for shipping, regional offers)
- Source (how they joined list)
- Age/gender (if collected)

**RFM Segmentation**:
- **R**ecency: When did they last purchase?
- **F**requency: How often do they purchase?
- **M**onetary: How much do they spend?

## 5. DELIVERABILITY

### Why Deliverability Matters

If your emails don't reach the inbox, nothing else matters.

**The Deliverability Equation**:
```
Inbox Placement = Sender Reputation × Content Quality × List Hygiene
```

### Key Deliverability Metrics

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Open Rate | 20-40% | <15% |
| Click Rate | 2-5% | <1% |
| Bounce Rate | <2% | >5% |
| Spam Complaint | <0.1% | >0.3% |
| Unsubscribe | <0.5% | >1% |

### The 6-Week Deliverability Protocol

For new accounts or accounts with damaged reputation:

**Week 1-2: Warm-Up**
- Send only to most engaged (30-day engaged)
- Low volume (25% of normal)
- High-value content only

**Week 3-4: Expansion**
- Expand to 60-day engaged
- Increase volume to 50%
- Mix of content and promotions

**Week 5-6: Scale**
- Full 60-90 day engaged segment
- Normal volume
- Monitor metrics closely

### Technical Deliverability Setup

**Required**:
1. **SPF Record**: Authorizes sending servers
2. **DKIM**: Cryptographic signature
3. **DMARC**: Policy for handling failures
4. **Custom Sending Domain**: sendmail.yourbrand.com

**The Footer Trick**: Include plain-text footer with business address and unsubscribe—improves deliverability.

### List Hygiene

**Sunset Flow**: Gradually remove unengaged subscribers
1. 90 days no engagement → winback attempt
2. 120 days no engagement → final attempt
3. 150 days no engagement → suppress from list

**Never Buy Lists**: Purchased lists destroy deliverability instantly.

## 6. EMAIL COPY & DESIGN

### Subject Line Formulas

**Curiosity Gap**:
- "The [thing] nobody talks about"
- "Why [common belief] is wrong"

**Urgency**:
- "Last chance: [offer] ends tonight"
- "[X] hours left"

**Personalization**:
- "[First name], you left something..."
- "Picked for you, [First name]"

**Benefit-Driven**:
- "Get [result] in [timeframe]"
- "The easiest way to [achieve outcome]"

**Social Proof**:
- "Why 10,000+ customers chose [product]"
- "[Celebrity/influencer] loves this"

### Email Copy Structure

**Above the Fold**:
- Hook (1-2 sentences)
- Hero image
- Primary CTA

**Body**:
- Value proposition
- Social proof
- Product details
- Secondary CTA

**Footer**:
- Contact info
- Social links
- Unsubscribe

### Design Best Practices

**Mobile-First**: 60%+ open on mobile
- Single column layout
- Large tap targets (44x44px minimum)
- Font size 16px+ body

**Images**:
- Optimize for fast loading
- Always include alt text
- Don't rely solely on images (spam filters)

**CTAs**:
- One primary CTA per email
- Button format (not just linked text)
- High contrast colors
- Action-oriented copy ("Shop Now" > "Click Here")

## 7. A/B TESTING

### What to Test

**High Impact**:
1. Subject lines (biggest impact on opens)
2. Send time
3. Offer/discount amount
4. CTA copy and placement

**Medium Impact**:
5. Email length
6. Image vs. no image
7. Preview text
8. From name

### Testing Framework

**Sample Size**: Need 1,000+ recipients per variant for statistical significance

**Test One Thing**: Only change one variable per test

**Duration**: Run for full campaign cycle (24-48 hours)

**Document Everything**: Keep record of tests and results

### Campaign A/B Tests

- Subject line A vs B
- Discount % vs $ off
- Single product vs multiple
- Short copy vs long copy

### Flow A/B Tests

- Timing between emails
- Number of emails in sequence
