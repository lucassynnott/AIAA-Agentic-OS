# SKILL BIBLE: Meta Algorithm Adaptation (Post-Andromeda)

> Source: Jeremy Haynes (Megalodon Marketing) - Helped 41+ businesses hit million-dollar months
> Context: Adapting to Facebook/Instagram's competitive density algorithm changes

---

## Executive Summary

Meta's algorithm updates have created "competitive density" - where expressing interest in any topic immediately serves 5-12 competitor ads in a row. This has accelerated market sophistication overnight, as buyers now see every alternative before making a purchase decision. This skill bible covers what changed, why it matters, and the specific strategies to win in this new environment.

## What Changed

### The Old Algorithm

**Interest expression flow:**
1. User clicks ad for Business A (tax strategist)
2. Sees more content
3. Maybe sees Business B (shoes)
4. More content
5. Maybe sees Business C (hotels)
6. Eventually remarkets with various interests

**Competitor exposure:** Occasional, mixed with other interests, spread over time

### The New Algorithm

**Interest expression flow:**
1. User clicks ad for Business A (tax strategist)
2. User leaves without converting
3. **Next 7+ ads = ALL tax strategists**
4. No deviation until user kills app

> "Without exaggeration, the next seven ads I see in a row were all tax strategists."

### The Result

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Gradual competitor awareness | Immediate competitor awareness |
| Mixed interest remarketing | Single-category saturation |
| Organic market sophistication | Forced market sophistication |
| Competitors over time | Competitors in minutes |

## The Business Impact

### Symptom: New Objections

Client spending $400-600K/month suddenly experienced:

> "Every lead is showing up saying, 'I'm considering buying from...' and they list off 2-5 different businesses."

**Before:** Occasional single competitor mentioned
**After:** Every qualified lead brings up multiple alternatives

### Why This Is Happening

**The click-but-don't-convert cascade:**

1. User clicks your ad
2. Doesn't convert (happens to most visitors)
3. Algorithm assumes: "Interested but not satisfied"
4. Serves every competitor to "help" user find solution
5. User becomes hyper-aware of alternatives
6. User arrives on your sales call as sophisticated buyer

### The Hidden Upside

> "If somebody who's spending more than you gets interest that doesn't convert, you're getting the sloppy seconds."

If you're NOT the market leader:
- Leader's unconverted traffic flows to you
- Their ad spend educates market for you
- Their sophistication helps you if you're positioned right

## Market Sophistication Acceleration

### Eugene Schwartz's Stages (Accelerated)

From *Breakthrough Advertising*:

| Stage | Description | Old Timeline | New Timeline |
|-------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Make the claim | Months | Hours |
| 2 | Enlarge the claim | Months | Hours |
| 3 | Show unique mechanism | Weeks | Hours |
| 4 | Show process + mechanism | Days | Hours |
| 5 | Identification/story | Days | Hours |

> "You can treat all advertising like they are these later stages of market sophistication and awareness. Skip straight to unique mechanism and process."

## The Solution Framework

### 1. Creative Range (Critical)

**The problem with limited creative:**
- Algorithm won't serve same ad repeatedly (bad UX)
- If you have 1-2 ads, you disappear from rotation
- Competitors with more creative win attention

**The solution:**
- Dynamic creative with many assets
- Multiple individual ad variations
- Different hooks, angles, formats
- Range of messaging approaches

> "If you have a single ad, you're pretty fucked with this algorithm."

### 2. Unique Mechanism Content

**What it is:** Content showing HOW you produce results differently

**Steakhouse example:**
- "We use a 1,800° broiler inches from the steak"
- "We only season with salt"
- "The fat sears while the center stays raw"

**Why it works:**
- Differentiates from competitors
- Gives closers something to anchor on
- Pre-frames before sales call
- Memorable and shareable

### 3. Process Content

**What it is:** The full journey of how you deliver results

**Steakhouse example:**
- Farm sourcing
- Butchering approach
- Dry-aging process
- Thickness of cuts
- Cooking method
- Plating/service

> "Process content can start way back if they want - farm to table - and flex on competitors who don't."

### 4. Hammer Them Campaign (Updated)

**Original strategy:**
- 30-50 short-form pieces
- 15-30 long-form pieces
- Blitz after key action (book call, etc.)
- Questions, objections, expectations content

**Updated for algorithm:**
- **Add unique mechanism content**
- **Add process content**
- Higher frequency than before
- Start earlier in the journey

### 5. Content Cycle Bins

**Different from Hammer Them:**
- Hammer Them = aggressive frequency goal
- Content Cycle Bin = available at right stages

**Purpose:** Ensure content available for algorithm to serve when user in your sales process, even without aggressive frequency targeting.

### 6. Reverse Fly Trap

**Original Venus Fly Trap:**
Content sequence → unlock next content → unlock next → DR ads

**Reverse Fly Trap:**
1. Direct response ads lead
2. Retargeting with more DR ads
3. Simultaneously serve content cycle bin
4. Unique mechanism + process content in rotation

**Why:** Capture interest AND differentiate simultaneously.

### 7. Breakout Videos (Updated)

**Confirmation page videos addressing:**
- Questions on prospect's mind
- Competitor comparisons (indirectly)
- Unique mechanism demonstration
- Process walkthrough
- Why different from alternatives

**Updated focus:**
> "We had to add a lot more content that talks about the unique mechanism of that business."

---

## Targeting Changes

### Cold Targeting = Suggestions

> "All cold targeting is essentially broad targeting at this point. Your targeting options are just suggestions."

**What still works:**
- Warm audience targeting (video viewers)
- Social interaction audiences
- Website visitors
- Email/customer lists
- These are still respected

### What This Means

- Less control over who sees your ads
- More importance on creative quality
- More importance on differentiation
- Algorithm matches interests, not demographics

---

## The Articulate Feedback Loop

### Why This Matters More Than Ever

> "If you have really articulate closers... you'll be able to tap into this new wave of reasons people aren't closing a lot faster than businesses who just get told 'all these leads are unqualified.'"

**Bad feedback:** "Leads are unqualified" (not actionable)
**Good feedback:** "Leads are mentioning competitors X, Y, Z and asking about [specific comparison points]"

### Using Feedback

1. Identify specific competitors mentioned
2. Create content addressing those comparisons
3. Add to hammer them campaigns
4. Add to breakout videos
5. Train closers on positioning

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions

**Creative:**
- [ ] Audit current ad quantity (need range)
- [ ] Create 10+ unique hook variations
- [ ] Develop unique mechanism content
- [ ] Develop process content

**Campaigns:**
- [ ] Update hammer them with new content types
- [ ] Set up content cycle bins
- [ ] Deploy reverse fly trap structure

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Single ad strategy** → Disappear from rotation
2. **Generic DR without differentiation** → Lost to competitors
3. **No unique mechanism content** → Nothing memorable
4. **Relying only on cold targeting** → Algorithm decides
5. **Waiting for feedback** → Too slow in new environment
6. **Not updating hammer them** → Missing differentiation
7. **Ignoring process content** → Missing depth opportunity
