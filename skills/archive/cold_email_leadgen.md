## Overview
Cold email is a highly effective client acquisition channel when done correctly. This skill covers modern cold email strategies, technical setup, and best practices for 2025.

## Core Components

### Lead Generation Process
1. **List Building** - Targeted prospect identification

### Technical Foundation (Deliverability)

#### Essential Setup

### Email Copy Best Practices
- **Subject Lines**: Short, relevant, non-spammy

### Follow-Up Sequence
