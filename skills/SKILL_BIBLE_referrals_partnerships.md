## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Referrals are the highest-quality, lowest-cost leads. A client who comes via referral is pre-sold, trusts you, and closes faster. Partnerships multiply your reach without proportional effort.

**Why Referrals Win**:
- Highest close rate (50%+)
- Lowest CAC
- Pre-built trust
- Better client quality
- Faster sales cycle

**The Referral Equation**:
```
Referrals = (Client Satisfaction × Ask Frequency × Ease of Referring) × Incentive
```

## 2. REFERRAL FUNDAMENTALS

### When Clients Refer

**They refer when**:
- They're getting results
- They're asked
- It's easy
- There's something in it for them (or feels good)

**They don't refer when**:
- They forget about you
- It's awkward or hard
- They're not sure who to refer
- Results are unclear

### The Referral Mindset

Asking for referrals is not pushy—it's helping your client's network.

If you deliver great results, their friends/colleagues need you too.

## 3. ASKING FOR REFERRALS

### When to Ask

**Best Moments**:
- After achieving a milestone/result
- After they express satisfaction
- During success celebration
- At renewal
- During review meetings

### How to Ask

**The Direct Ask**:
```
"[Name], I'm so glad we've been able to [result] together.

I'm curious—do you know anyone else in your network who might benefit from similar results?

Doesn't have to be a perfect fit, just someone you think might be struggling with [problem we solve]."
```

**The Specific Ask**:
```
"Who do you know who's [specific situation]?

Like if you think about your [mastermind / LinkedIn connections / business friends], who comes to mind?"
```

**The Permission Ask**:
```
"Would you be open to introducing me to a few people who might benefit?

I'd love to help more people like you."
```

### Follow-Up

After they mention someone:
```
"Great—would you be comfortable making a quick intro? Even just a text or email saying 'Hey, you should talk to [Your Name]' would be amazing."
```

## 4. REFERRAL PROGRAMS

### Formal vs Informal

**Informal**: Ask when appropriate, no structure
- Pros: Natural, no overhead
- Cons: Inconsistent, forgettable

**Formal**: Documented program with incentives

- "Just help your friends"
- Works for great relationships

**Credit/Discount**:
- "10% off next month for each referral"

**Cash**:
- "$500 for each referral that closes"
- Clear, motivating

**Reciprocal**:
- "Free month for you, discount for them"
- Both parties benefit

**Tiered**:
- 1 referral: $200
- 3 referrals: $750
- 5+ referrals: $1,500 + VIP status

### Program Structure

**Clear Terms**:
- Who qualifies as a referral
- When/how payout happens
- Any minimums or limits

**Easy Process**:
- Simple way to submit referral
- Tracking communicated
- Quick payout/recognition
