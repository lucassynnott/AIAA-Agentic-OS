# Create Email Campaign - Complete Campaign Strategy & Execution

Expert skill for creating high-performing email campaigns that drive revenue and engagement through strategic content, design, and optimization.

## Why Email Campaigns Matter

Campaigns are your consistent revenue driver:
- **Cost**: 40x cheaper than paid ads
- **ROI**: $36-42 for every $1 spent
- **Audience**: Customers who already know/like/trust you
- **Purpose**: Stay top-of-mind, drive consistent traffic and sales

## The 3.5 Pillars of Email Marketing

Email campaigns are Pillar #3 (alongside list growth, flows, and deliverability). Send **3-4 campaigns per week** for optimal results.

## Campaign Sending Strategy

### Optimal Frequency
**3-4 campaigns per week** is the sweet spot:
- Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday (4x/week)
- Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday (3x/week)
- More frequent = better as long as content is good

### Why Send More Often

**Data-Backed Results**:
- Open rates: Increase 14% (60%+ average)
- Click rates: Increase 75% (1.02% → 1.77%)
- Conversion rates: Increase consistently
- Unsubscribe rates: Stay flat or decrease (with good content)

**Top of Mind Effect**: Consistent sending = when customer thinks "I need [product]", they think of YOU first.

### Campaign Types

**Education & Nurture (80%)**: 5:1 ratio vs promotional
- Social proof (testimonials, reviews, UGC)
- Benefits (product features, use cases)
- News (launches, company updates)
- Trending/popular products
- Tips, how-tos, guides
- Behind-the-scenes, brand story

**Promotional & Discounts (20%)**:

- Flash sales
- Holiday promotions
- Product launches with offers

### Phase 2: Klaviyo Campaign Setup

#### Step 1: Create Campaign

1. Klaviyo → Campaigns → "Create Campaign"
2. Name campaign internally (descriptive):
   - Format: "[Date] - [Type] - [Topic]"
   - Example: "Dec 15 - Educational - Holiday Gift Guide"
3. Select date/time to send
4. Choose channel: Email

#### Step 2: Select Recipients

**Best Practice**: Send to engaged segments, not entire list

**Recommended Segments**:

**Engaged 60-90 Days**:
```
Definition:
- Opened OR Clicked email in last 60-90 days
- OR: Placed order in last 60-90 days
- OR: Added to list in last 30 days
```

**Why**: Only send to people who want your emails = better deliverability

**Create in Klaviyo**:
1. Audience → Lists & Segments → Create Segment
2. Name: "Engaged 60 Days"
3. Conditions:
   - Someone is in Newsletter list
   - AND (Opened email at least once in last 60 days
   - OR Clicked email at least once in last 60 days
   - OR Placed order in last 60 days
   - OR Added to list in last 30 days)

**Suppression**: Who NOT to send to
- Recently purchased (optional - test this)
- Currently in sensitive flows
- Already received campaign today (if sending multiple)

#### Step 3: Subject Line & Preview Text

**Subject Line Formula**:

**Curiosity**: "You're going to love this..."
**Benefit**: "Get glowing skin in 7 days"
**Urgency**: "24 hours only: 30% off"
**Personalization**: "[Name], this is perfect for you"
**Question**: "Ready for summer?"
**Social Proof**: "Why 10K+ customers love this"
**News**: "Just dropped: New [Product]"
**FOMO**: "Almost sold out..."

**Subject Line Best Practices**:
- Keep under 50 characters
- Front-load important words
- Use emojis strategically (test with/without)
- Personalize when appropriate
- Create curiosity but avoid clickbait
- Be specific, not generic
- Test different styles

**Preview Text**:
- Complements subject line (don't repeat it)
- Expands on the promise
- 40-90 characters
- Include call to action or benefit
- Example: Subject "New Arrival Alert" → Preview "Plus: Free shipping this weekend only"

**Subject Line Examples by Campaign Type**:

**Educational**:
- "5 mistakes you're making with [product]"
- "How to [achieve benefit] in 3 simple steps"
- "Everything you need to know about [topic]"

**Social Proof**:
- "Why Sarah calls this 'life-changing'"
- "1,000+ 5-star reviews (see why)"
- "Customer photos that will inspire you"

**Product Launch**:
- "Finally here: [Product Name]"
- "You asked, we listened: New [Product]"
- "Introducing your new favorite [product]"

**Promotional**:
- "Flash Sale: 30% off ends midnight"
- "Weekend only: Free shipping"
- "BOGO Alert: Buy 1, Get 1 Free"

```

8. Discount amounts

**How to A/B Test in Klaviyo**:
1. Create campaign normally
2. Before sending, click "A/B Test"
3. Choose what to test (subject line most common)
4. Set split: 50/50 or other
5. Define winning metric (opens, clicks, revenue)
6. Set test duration
7. Winner auto-sends to remaining list

**Best Practices**:
- Test one variable at a time
- Minimum 1,000 recipients for statistical significance
- Let test run full cycle (24-48 hours)
- Document learnings
- Apply winners to future campaigns

## Campaign Calendar Template

**Weekly Schedule**:

| Day | Campaign Type | Topic Example |
|-----|--------------|---------------|
| Monday | Educational | "5 Ways to Use [Product]" |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sending too infrequently**: Out of sight, out of mind
2. **All promotional**: Provide value, not just discounts
3. **Weak subject lines**: First impression matters
4. **Not mobile-optimized**: 60%+ opens are mobile
5. **No clear CTA**: Tell them what to do
6. **Too much text**: Keep it scannable
7. **Generic content**: Personalize when possible
8. **Not testing**: Always be testing
9. **Ignoring metrics**: Data tells you what works
10. **Bad timing**: Know when your audience opens emails

## Quick Win Checklist

Want immediate improvements? Do these:
- [ ] Increase send frequency to 3-4x/week
- [ ] Clean your list (segment to engaged only)
- [ ] Improve subject lines (test 3 variations)
- [ ] Mobile-optimize every email
- [ ] Add social proof to every campaign
- [ ] Include customer photos/reviews
- [ ] Make CTAs larger and clearer
- [ ] Reduce text, add more images
- [ ] Test send times
- [ ] Add urgency to promotional emails

---

**Pro Tip**: Consistent campaigns = consistent revenue. The brands that send 3-4x/week with good content outperform brands sending 1x/week by 300-500%. Don't be afraid to send more if you're providing value.

**Remember**: Email is YOUR channel. You own the list. Unlike social media algorithms, every subscriber gets your email (if you maintain good deliverability). Use this power wisely and consistently.
