## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Communication is the #1 predictor of client satisfaction. Clear systems prevent miscommunication, missed messages, and frustrated clients.

**Communication Principles**:
- Over-communicate (clients assume the worst in silence)
- Respond quickly
- Be proactive, not reactive
- Document everything

---

## 2. SLACK CHANNEL STRUCTURE

### Per-Client Setup

**#client-general**
- Main communication
- Client + team
- Day-to-day discussion

**#client-creative** (if applicable)
- Creative feedback
- Asset sharing
- Approval requests

**#client-data**
- Metrics and reporting
- Performance updates

**#client-internal** (team only)
- Internal discussion
- Strategy conversations
- Issues/concerns

### Naming Convention

```
#clientname-general
#clientname-creative
#clientname-data
#clientname-internal
```

Consistent naming = easy navigation.

### Response Times
