## THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF HIGH-CONVERTING EMAIL DESIGN

### 1. BIG BUTTONS = HIGHER CLICKS

**The Principle:** The bigger the button, the higher the clicks. Period.

**What Bad Looks Like:**
- Small, hard-to-see buttons
- Buttons that blend with the background
- Text links instead of buttons

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Buttons at least 48px height
- High contrast colors (brand primary on white, or white on brand primary)
- Full-width on mobile
- Rounded corners (8px radius)

**Implementation:**
```
BUTTON SPECIFICATIONS:
- Height: 48-56px minimum
- Width: Auto or full-width on mobile
- Padding: 16px 32px
- Font: 14-16px, bold, ALL CAPS or Title Case
- Border-radius: 8px
- Color: High contrast (if background is light, button is dark)
```

---

### 2. BUTTON + OFFER AT THE TOP OF THE EMAIL

**The Principle:** When someone opens your email on mobile, they only see the first 300-400px. Your button and offer MUST be visible without scrolling.

**What Bad Looks Like (Calvin Klein example):**
- Hero image is just a shirtless dude with no button visible
- Discount code is buried way down the email
- Customer has to scroll to find the value

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Welcome headline with discount prominently displayed
- Shop button visible immediately
- Customer knows exactly what to do in 2 seconds

**Implementation:**
```
HERO SECTION STRUCTURE:
1. Logo (120px width, centered or left)
2. Headline with offer: "WELCOME! GET 15% OFF"
3. Discount code: Large, bold, can't miss it
4. CTA Button: "SHOP NOW" - full width, high contrast
5. All above 400px from top of email
```

---

### 3. NO NAVIGATION BUTTONS AT THE TOP

**The Principle:** Navigation links (Shop Men | Shop Women | Sale) at the top cause decision fatigue and distract from the email's purpose.

**What Bad Looks Like (Birkenstock, Gymshark examples):**
- 5-6 navigation buttons right when you open
- Customer is overwhelmed with options
- Scroll rate plummets because they bounce

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Clean hero with single focus
- Navigation buttons ONLY in footer
- After viewing products, customer is ready to browse categories

**Implementation:**
```
HEADER BAR:
- Logo only (centered or left)
- Optional: Discount banner bar above logo
- NO: Shop | New | Sale | Men | Women links

FOOTER (where nav belongs):
- Category buttons: [Shop Women] [Shop Men] [New Arrivals] [Sale]
- Social icons
- Unsubscribe/Legal
```

---

### 4. INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS NEED SHOP NOW BUTTONS

**The Principle:** Don't assume customers know they can click on product images. Make it explicit with individual "Shop Now" buttons per product.

**What Bad Looks Like (Aloe Aloe example):**
- Product grid with no buttons
- Customer doesn't know what's clickable
- Missed clicks = missed revenue

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Each product has its own "Shop Now" button or underlined text
- Customer knows exactly where to click
- Even underlining product names improves clicks

**Implementation:**
```
PRODUCT CARD STRUCTURE:
┌─────────────────┐
│  [Product Image] │
│     300x300px    │
├─────────────────┤
│  Product Name    │
│  $XX.XX          │
│ [SHOP NOW]       │ <- 40px height button
└─────────────────┘

ALTERNATIVE: Underline product name if space is tight
```

---

### 5. END WITH A GENERAL SHOP BUTTON

**The Principle:** What if the customer doesn't like ANY of the featured products? Give them an escape hatch to keep browsing.

**What Bad Looks Like:**
- Email ends with featured products
- Customer scrolls to bottom, doesn't like anything, leaves
- Lost opportunity

**What Good Looks Like:**
- After product section: "SHOP ALL [CATEGORY]" button
- Gives options for customers who didn't find what they wanted
- Keeps them on site instead of bouncing

**Implementation:**
```
AFTER PRODUCT GRID:
─────────────────────────
  Didn't find what you're looking for?

  [SHOP ALL TOPS]  <- Full width button

  or browse by category:
  [Women] [Men] [Sale]
─────────────────────────
```

---

### 6. FOOTER CATEGORY BUTTONS ARE MANDATORY

**The Principle:** Every email should end with category browse buttons. Someone might open a "Tops" email but actually want pants.

**What Bad Looks Like:**
- Email ends abruptly
- No further browsing options
- Customer leaves if featured products don't appeal

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Clear footer section
- Shop by category buttons
- Social proof elements
- Final CTA opportunity

**Implementation:**
```
FOOTER STRUCTURE:
─────────────────────────
[SHOP WOMEN] [SHOP MEN] [NEW ARRIVALS]

Follow us: [IG] [TT] [FB]

[Unsubscribe] | [Privacy]
© 2025 Brand Name | City, State
─────────────────────────
```

---

### 7. MAKE EMAILS IMMERSIVE, NOT FLAT

**The Principle:** Flat, corporate emails don't release dopamine. Immersive, well-designed emails keep people opening and eventually converting.

**What Bad Looks Like (Whoop example):**
- Just text and images slapped together
- No visual flow
- Looks like a newsletter from 2010

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Backgrounds that match/transition from hero image
- Elements that overlap sections (phones, products extending)
- Gradients that connect sections
- Visual storytelling

**Implementation:**
```
IMMERSION TECHNIQUES:

1. Background Continuity:
   - Hero image has gray background
   - Next section also gray, seamless transition
   - Or use gradient to transition colors

2. Overlapping Elements:
   - Product image extends from hero into body section
   - Phone mockup breaks the section boundary
   - Creates depth and visual interest

3. Lifestyle Integration:
   - Background images that extend behind content
   - Product in context, not just white background
   - Environmental elements (snow, nature, city)
```

---

### 8. MATCH YOUR BRAND VIBE

**The Principle:** Your email should look like it came from YOUR brand, not a generic template.

**What Bad Looks Like (Calvin Klein example):**
- Website is clean, minimal black/white
- Email is full of rainbow colors
- Disconnect confuses customers

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Email design matches website aesthetic
- Same color palette, fonts, imagery style
- Customer recognizes brand instantly

**Implementation:**
```
BRAND CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST:
□ Primary brand color used for CTAs
□ Secondary colors from brand palette only
□ Typography matches website (or similar)
□ Image style matches website (lifestyle vs product)
□ Tone of voice consistent with brand
□ Logo placement matches brand guidelines
```

---

### 9. HERO IMAGE MUST REPRESENT YOUR CUSTOMER

**The Principle:** If you sell to men AND women, your hero image should reflect that. One demographic in the hero = losing the other.

**What Bad Looks Like (Calvin Klein example):**
- Hero image is just a shirtless man
- Women on the list feel excluded
- Missing half your potential clicks

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Hero shows BOTH men and women (or product only)
- Customer can see themselves in the image
- Tested: Better hero images can DOUBLE revenue

**Implementation:**
```
HERO IMAGE SELECTION:

For Mixed Audience:
- Show both genders using product
- Or show product only (neutral)
- Or split hero: left=women, right=men

For Specific Audience:
- Match your ICP exactly
- Age, style, setting should resonate
- Lifestyle shots > studio shots
```

---

### 10. FULL IMAGE EMAILS ARE TOTALLY FINE

**The Principle:** Ignore the propaganda that you "can't do image-based emails." You absolutely can. Max's agency does $10M+/month with pure image-based emails.

**What Bad Looks Like (Aloe Aloe example):**
- Using Klaviyo's HTML sections
- Light/dark mode breaks the design
- Looks janky and unprofessional

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Full-width designed images
- Consistent appearance in all modes
- Professional, polished look

**Implementation:**
```
IMAGE-BASED EMAIL APPROACH:

Technical Setup:
- Design in Figma/Photoshop at 600px width
- Export as optimized JPEG/PNG
- Slice into sections for links
- Each slice is a separate image with link

Benefits:
- Perfect control over design
- No light/dark mode issues
- Faster to produce once templates exist

Considerations:
- Alt text REQUIRED for accessibility
- Keep file sizes optimized (<200KB per section)
- Test in multiple clients
```

## FIGMA DESIGN PROCESS (Step-by-Step)

This is Max's exact process for designing emails in Figma that has generated $20M+ for partner brands.

### Why Figma Over Canva
- Canva is too simplistic and hard to organize
- Figma has more capabilities
- Emails always turn out better
- Better layer organization and export features

### Step 1: Set Up Your Frame
```
EMAIL FRAME SPECIFICATIONS:
- Width: 600px (standard email width)
- Height: Variable (extend as needed)
- Name: "[Brand] Email - [Campaign Name]"
```

### Step 2: Build the Logo Section
```
LOGO SECTION:
- Width: 600px
- Height: 80-100px
- Background: White or brand color
- Logo: Centered, ~120px width
```

### Step 3: Create the Hero Section
```
HERO BUILDING PROCESS:
1. Find a background image that matches brand vibe
2. Set image width to 600px
3. Add gradient overlay for text readability:
   - Create rectangle over image
   - Apply gradient: Solid color → Transparent
   - Direction: Top to bottom
4. Add headline, body copy, button on top of gradient
5. Crop hero to ~500px height max
```

### Step 4: Add Depth with Gradients
```
GRADIENT TECHNIQUE FOR DEPTH:
1. Create rectangle behind content
2. Click Fill → Switch to Gradient tab
3. Set direction: Top to bottom
4. Bottom color: White or transparent
5. Top color: Gray or brand accent
6. Result: Section has depth, not flat
```

### Step 5: Build Product Sections
```
PRODUCT GRID LAYOUT:
- Use S-curve or staggered layout for visual interest
- Equal spacing between products (measure with rectangle tool)
- Each product needs:
  * Product image
  * Product name
  * Star rating + review count
  * Brief description (e.g., "Light support")
  * Individual "SHOP NOW" button
- Add decorative lines/borders for depth
- End with general "SHOP BESTSELLERS" button
```

### Step 6: Create the Footer
```
FOOTER ELEMENTS:
1. Browse buttons: [WOMEN] [MEN] with divider lines
2. Social media icons (separate for individual links)
3. Trust badges: Afterpay, Free Shipping, Returns, Support
4. Legal text (built in Klaviyo)
```

### Step 7: Organize Layers
```
LAYER ORGANIZATION:
├── Logo Section
│   ├── Background
│   └── Logo
├── Hero Section
│   ├── Background Image
│   ├── Gradient Overlay
│   ├── Headline
│   ├── Subheadline
│   └── Button
├── Bridge Section
│   ├── Background
│   ├── Headline
│   └── Content blocks
├── Product Section
│   ├── Product 1 (grouped)
│   ├── Product 2 (grouped)
│   ├── Product 3 (grouped)
│   └── Shop All Button
└── Footer Section
    ├── Browse Buttons
    ├── Social Icons
    └── Trust Badges
```

---

## KLAVIYO UPLOAD PROCESS

### Step 1: Slice the Design
```
SLICING RULES:
- Each clickable area = separate slice
- Keep image files reasonable size (not too big)
- Product sections: Slice each product individually
- Footer icons: Slice each icon separately for unique links

FIGMA SLICE TOOL:
1. Click Slice tool in toolbar
2. Draw over section you want
3. Export at 2X as JPEG
4. Name clearly (slice1, slice2, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Compress Images
```
COMPRESSION PROCESS:
1. Go to iloveimg.com/compress-image
2. Upload all slices at once
3. Download compressed batch
4. Original: 1.72MB → Compressed: 327KB (81% smaller!)
```

### Step 3: Upload to Klaviyo
```
KLAVIYO BUILD PROCESS:
1. Create campaign → Drag and drop editor
2. Delete all default sections
3. Keep only unsubscribe footer
4. Drag "Image" blocks for each slice
5. Upload compressed images in order
6. For social icons: Use TABLE block
   - Add columns for each icon
   - Remove padding (set to 0)
   - Change each cell to "Image"
```

### Step 4: Add Links and Alt Text
```
LINK SETUP:
- Click each image
- Paste destination URL in "Link address"
- Logo → Homepage
- Hero button → Collection/Sale page
- Product images → Product pages
- Social icons → Social profiles

ALT TEXT:
- Add descriptive text for each image
- Used when images don't load
- Example: "They're back - new shipment of bestsellers"
```

---

## DESIGN DEPTH TECHNIQUES

### The Gradient Overlay Method
```
PURPOSE: Make text readable over images

STEPS:
1. Place image as background
2. Create rectangle same width as image
3. Fill → Gradient → Top to Bottom
4. Top stop: Solid color (black/brand color)
5. Bottom stop: Transparent
6. Adjust gradient position until text is readable
```

### The Decorative Line Technique
```
PURPOSE: Add depth and visual interest to product sections

APPLICATION:
- Add thin lines beside product images
- Creates "framing" effect
- Carry the theme throughout email
- Use brand accent color or black
```

### The Section Depth Gradient
```
PURPOSE: Prevent flat, boring white backgrounds

STEPS:
1. Create rectangle behind content
2. Apply gradient: Gray → White
3. Direction: Top to bottom
4. Creates subtle depth without being distracting
```

### The Spacing Measurement Technique
```
PURPOSE: Ensure equal spacing between elements

STEPS:
1. Create temporary rectangle
2. Place between two elements
3. Check width in properties panel
4. Repeat for other gaps
5. Adjust until all gaps are equal
6. Delete temporary rectangles
```
