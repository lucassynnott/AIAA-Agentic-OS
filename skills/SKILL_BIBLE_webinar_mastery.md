## Executive Summary

Live webinars have been resurrected as an S-tier funnel. This skill bible covers the complete execution process: financial modeling, asset creation, promotion cycles, backend systems, and bottleneck analysis. When executed correctly, webinars convert cold traffic into high-ticket buyers at scale.

---

## Phase 1: Financial Modeling

### Why Start With Math

> "The quantity of people who haven't done a lick of math and then just vaporize money willingly because they didn't know how bad each statistic could be before crossing into unprofitable territory."

**Purpose:** Know worst-case scenario stats BEFORE spending money

### The Model Variables

| Variable | Conservative | Dialed-In | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Cost per opt-in | $30 | $10-20 | Higher for sophisticated/rich audiences |
| Show rate (cold) | 10-15% | 25-35% | First webinar bias lower |
| Show rate (warm) | 30-40% | 50-60% | Established audiences |
| Book rate | 10% | 20-30% | % of attendees booking calls |
| Call show rate | 50-60% | 70%+ | Webinar leads should show at high rate |
| Close rate | 20% | 30-50% | Below 30% = fire closer or fix webinar |
| AOV | Factor splits | Factor PIFs | Cash collected, not sticker price |

### Test Budget Calculation

**The Tipping Point:**
> "Below a certain threshold of spend, the probabilities are all over the place. Above a certain level of spend, we rid ourselves of randomness."

**Typical test budget:** $25,000 - $50,000 per webinar

**Calculate:** Worst-case scenario stats → How much spend before we know if it works?

## Phase 2: Asset Creation

### Funnel Pages Required

1. **Opt-in Page** - Webinar registration
2. **Confirmation Page** - Post-opt-in (critical for backend selling)
3. **Replay Page** - Post-webinar recording
4. **Application Page** - For call booking (if not direct checkout)
5. **Scheduler** - Embedded or linked
6. **Call Confirmation Page** - Post-booking
7. **Checkout Page** - For direct sales or deposits
8. **Purchase Confirmation** - Post-purchase

### Video Ads (Critical)

**Andromeda Requirements:**
- 25-30 video ads minimum
- 25-30 image ads on standby
- Multiple hooks, angles, formats
- Dynamic copy (5 headlines, 5 body copy variations)

> "You have to follow the Andromeda best practices. There's not a smaller amount of creatives they let you launch with."

**Video Ad Style:**
- Talking head
- Jump cuts
- Captions
- Nothing overly produced

**Image Ads:**
- Headline of webinar/topic
- Clear value proposition
- Mobile-optimized

### Email Sequence

**NOT just reminders - Value Dense:**
- Topics people care about
- Increases show probability
- Long-form written content
- Sent prior to webinar

### Text Sequence

**Critical Learning:**
> "We do NOT send the Zoom link in texts. That nuked our booking rate. People showed up on phones, booking rate was terrible."

- Reminder texts only
- No Zoom link
- Some value-oriented messages
- Keep simple

### Webinar Slides

- Follow proven outline structure
- Risk reversal sections
- Clear pitch timing
- Retention mechanics built in

---

## Phase 3: Promotion Timeline

### First Webinar (New/Untested)

**Timeline:** 10-14 days before webinar

**Why longer:**
- Time to fix broken tech
- Time to refilm ads if needed
- Time to optimize opt-in page
- Less pressure = better decisions

### Dialed-In Webinar (Proven)

**Timeline:** 3-5 days before webinar

**Why shorter:**
- Show rate higher with closer opt-ins
- Already know what works
- Less decay time

### Show Rate by Opt-In Timing

| Opt-In Timing | Relative Show Rate |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 14+ days out | Lowest |
| 7-13 days out | Low |
| 3-6 days out | Moderate |
| 1-2 days out | High |
| Day of | Highest |

> "Map individual show rate by contact creation date. You'll see people who opt in 48+ hours out have dramatically lower show rates."

---

## Phase 4: Backend Selling Systems

### 1. Hammer Them Campaign (Paid)

**For opt-ins before webinar:**
- 30-50 short-form content pieces
- 15-30 long-form content pieces
- Frequency goal: 15-20 impressions
- Content categories: Questions, objections, expectations

**For call bookings after webinar:**
- Separate hammer them sequence
- Congratulations on booking
- Preparation content
- Trust building

### 2. Confirmation Page Best Practices (Free)

**Breakout Videos:**
- 5-20 individual videos
- 1-3 minutes each
- Address questions in prospect's mind
- Best AND worst case testimonials

### 3. Value Dense Email Sequences (Free)

**Pre-webinar:**
- Why they should attend
- What they'll learn
- Success stories
- Objection handling

**Post-booking:**
- Call preparation
- What to expect
- Additional value

### 4. Setter Best Practices (Free)

**Pre-webinar:**
- Call opt-ins to confirm attendance
- Answer questions
- Build relationship

**Post-webinar:**
- Reach out to attendees who didn't book
- Congratulate those who booked
- Prepare for call (sales call, not education call)

---

## Phase 5: Promotion Execution

### During Promotion Cycle

**Primary Metrics:**
1. Cost per lead (efficiency)
2. Show rate (engagement)

**CHECK THE TECH:**

Common issues:
- Zapier hitting limits
- Buttons not working on mobile
- Tracking discrepancies
- Zaps breaking

> "We caught a Zapier limit 4 hours before the webinar. Couple hundred person discrepancy."

**How to Identify:**
- 1% opt-in rate = likely tech issue
- 10-15% opt-in rate = CRO issue (can improve)
- Tracking discrepancy = definitely tech issue

### Paid vs Organic Split

**If mixing audiences:**
1. Duplicate funnel for each source
2. Track separately
3. Different stats for each
4. Know what's actually profitable

---

## Phase 6: Webinar Execution

### Live vs Automated

**Live webinars ONLY:**
> "Auto webinars have been nerfed. Taking webinars that converted extremely well, trying to automate them - not working."

**Why Live Works:**
- 1/3 of buyers watch multiple webinars
- Repeat viewers see auto is same content
- Trust erosion with automated
- Live builds authentic connection

### Critical Retention Metric

**Peak Show Rate → Time of Pitch:**
- Target: 80% retention
- Measure: People at peak vs people at pitch time

### Bonus Bait Strategy

> "Bait people with bonuses for staying until the pitch. Send bonuses right after webinar concludes to people who stayed live."

- Announce bonuses early
- Deliver immediately post-webinar
- Only to live attendees
- Creates retention incentive

---

## Phase 7: Post-Webinar Execution

### Immediate Actions

1. **Upload replay** to replay page
2. **Send replay + bonuses** to all opt-ins (showed or not)
3. **Application embedded** on replay page
4. **Milk the replay** for additional conversions

### If Call Booking Model

**Post-booking stats to track:**
- Call show rate (target 70%+)
- Close rate (target 30-50%)
- AOV (PIF vs payment plans)

**Backend Systems for Booked Calls:**
- Separate hammer them sequence
- Separate confirmation page
- Setter outreach pre-call
- Value dense emails

---

## Phase 8: Bottleneck Analysis

### The Non-Random Truth

> "It's not random when a webinar doesn't work. There's a specific bottleneck, a specific statistic contracted that if you put attention on and open up, gets a lot more money out the other side."

### Diagnostic Framework

| Symptom | Likely Bottleneck | Action |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| High CPL, everything else good | Opt-in page or ads | Fix creative, improve page |
| Good CPL, low show rate | Backend systems | Add hammer them, setters |
| Good show, low book rate | Webinar content | Redo webinar, improve pitch |
| Good book, low call show | Post-booking systems | Add call confirmation systems |
| Good call show, low close | Sales team or lead quality | Train closers or fix webinar framing |
| Low AOV | Pricing or payment options | Add financing, improve value stack |

### What to Check First

1. **Tech issues** - Always rule out first
2. **CPM/CTR** - Ad performance
3. **Opt-in rate** - Page conversion
4. **Show rate** - Backend systems
5. **Conversion rate** - Webinar quality
6. **Close rate** - Sales team

2. **Too short promotion cycle** → No time to fix issues
3. **Not enough creative variety** → Andromeda penalty
4. **Reminder-only emails** → Low show rates
5. **No setters on leads** → Missed show rate opportunity

7. **No financial modeling** → Don't know when stats are in danger zone
8. **No bottleneck analysis** → Can't diagnose what's broken
9. **Not milking replay** → Leaving money on table
10. **No bonus bait** → Lower retention to pitch
