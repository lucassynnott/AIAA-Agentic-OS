# SKILL BIBLE: EMAIL DELIVERABILITY & LIST HEALTH
## The Definitive Guide Based on Max Sturtevant's $40M+ Methodology

### Executive Summary

Email deliverability is the invisible foundation that determines whether your email marketing generates millions or fails completely. Max Sturtevant, who has generated over $40 million in ecommerce email marketing revenue, reveals that deliverability isn't just about avoiding spam folders—it's about building a reputation with inbox providers that ensures your emails land in the primary inbox where they can actually drive revenue.

The harsh reality is that even the most beautifully designed emails with perfect copy are worthless if they never reach your customers. Max's methodology focuses on three critical pillars: technical setup (DMARC, CNAME, TXT records), engagement optimization (open rates above 50%, click rates above 5%), and strategic warming (gradual volume increases with engaged segments). His approach has consistently achieved 60%+ open rates and helped brands scale from zero to $500,000+ monthly email revenue.

This system is built on the understanding that inbox providers like Gmail, Apple, and Outlook are constantly evolving their filtering algorithms. What worked in 2023 is often completely useless in 2026. Max's framework adapts to these changes by focusing on fundamental engagement metrics and reputation building rather than trying to game the system with outdated tactics.

The methodology outlined here has been tested across hundreds of brands, from startups to 9-figure companies, generating consistent results when properly implemented. Every tactic, benchmark, and strategy comes directly from Max's real-world experience managing email campaigns that drive millions in revenue.

## PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

### Core Philosophy

Max's fundamental belief is that email deliverability can be summarized in 10 seconds: "It's your engagement optimization. Getting people to open and click your emails." Everything else—technical setup, warming periods, segmentation—serves this single purpose of proving to inbox providers that real people want to receive and engage with your emails.

The philosophy centers on building what Max calls your "domain credit score"—similar to a financial credit score, but for email sending. Just as banks trust you with money based on your financial history, inbox providers trust you with inbox placement based on your sending reputation. This reputation is built through consistent engagement patterns, proper technical setup, and gradual volume increases that prove you're a legitimate sender.

Max emphasizes that deliverability is not a set-it-and-forget-it system. It requires constant monitoring, adjustment, and optimization. The inbox landscape changes rapidly, with providers like Gmail implementing new filtering mechanisms regularly. Success comes from understanding the underlying principles rather than relying on specific tactics that may become obsolete.

### Key Principles

**1. Engagement is Everything**
Your open rates, click rates, and reply rates are the holy grail metrics that directly tell inbox providers whether people want your emails. Max targets minimum 50% open rates and 5% click rates. Anything below these benchmarks signals to providers that your emails may be unwanted.

**2. Technical Setup is Non-Negotiable**
DMARC, CNAME, and TXT records must be properly configured. Max specifically recommends using tools like Glock Apps to verify your technical setup. Missing or incorrect technical configuration can immediately flag your domain as untrustworthy.

**3. Warming is Mandatory for New Domains**
Never send to large lists immediately with a new domain or IP. Max's warming process starts with 200-400 people and gradually increases by 50-100% each send, monitoring engagement metrics at each stage.

**4. Consistency Builds Trust**
Inbox providers look for consistent sending patterns. Max recommends sending at least 2-3 emails per week to maintain visibility with providers. Sporadic sending patterns appear spammy and hurt deliverability.

**5. Segmentation Prevents Reputation Damage**
Sending to unengaged subscribers destroys your reputation. Max uses engagement windows—only sending to people who have engaged within specific timeframes.

> **📊 STANDARDIZED ENGAGEMENT TIERS (Cross-Reference: SKILL_BIBLE_ecom_email_advanced_strategies.md, SKILL_BIBLE_email_list_segmentation.md)**
> | Tier | Window | Use Case |
> |------|--------|----------|
> | Highly Engaged | 30 days | Warming, testing, critical sends |
> | Engaged | 60 days | Regular campaigns (primary revenue driver) |
> | Lapsing | 90 days | Re-engagement campaigns |
> | At-Risk | 120 days | Final re-engagement before suppression |

**6. Volume Scaling Must Be Gradual**
Sudden volume spikes trigger spam filters. Max's approach involves careful volume increases, monitoring engagement at each level before expanding further.

**7. Content Quality Affects Algorithmic Scoring**
While engagement matters most, content still impacts deliverability. Max avoids spam trigger words like "sale," "free trial," and excessive capitalization, especially in subject lines.

**8. Unsubscribe Rates Are Critical Indicators**
Max targets unsubscribe rates below 0.1%. Higher rates signal to providers that recipients don't want your emails, directly impacting future deliverability.

**9. Spam Complaint Rates Must Stay Minimal**
Complaint rates above 0.5% cause serious deliverability issues. Max monitors this metric closely and adjusts strategy immediately if rates climb.

**10. Provider-Specific Optimization**
Different providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) have different filtering mechanisms. Max tracks performance across providers and adjusts strategies accordingly.

**11. Automation Flows Protect Reputation**
High-engagement flows (welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase) help maintain overall account reputation even when campaign performance fluctuates.

**12. Monitoring Tools Are Essential**
Max uses Glock Apps for deliverability testing and Klaviyo's native reporting for engagement tracking. Regular monitoring catches issues before they become critical.

### The Framework Overview

Max's deliverability framework operates on three interconnected levels:

**Foundation Level:** Technical setup and domain configuration that establishes basic trust with inbox providers.

**Engagement Level:** Content and segmentation strategies that drive the engagement metrics providers use to determine reputation.

**Optimization Level:** Ongoing monitoring, testing, and adjustment based on performance data and provider algorithm changes.

The framework recognizes that deliverability is both a technical and marketing challenge. Technical setup gets you in the game, but engagement optimization determines whether you win or lose. The system is designed to be sustainable long-term, building genuine engagement rather than trying to manipulate provider algorithms.

## PART 2: STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Technical Foundation Setup (Days 1-3)**

1. **Domain Configuration**
   - Set up DMARC records through your domain provider
   - Configure CNAME and TXT records as specified by your email platform
   - Verify all technical setup using Glock Apps (glockapps.com)
   - Ensure SPF and DKIM records are properly aligned

2. **Platform Integration**
   - Connect domain to email platform (Klaviyo recommended)
   - Verify domain ownership and authentication
   - Set up tracking and analytics integration
   - Configure unsubscribe handling and compliance features

3. **Initial Testing**
   - Run full spam test through Glock Apps
   - Send test emails to multiple provider types (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook)
   - Verify emails land in primary inbox, not promotions or spam
   - Check all links, images, and tracking functionality

**Phase 2: List Segmentation and Preparation (Days 4-7)**

4. **Engagement Segmentation**
   - Create 90-day engaged segment (opened email, clicked, or active on site)
   - Create 30-day highly engaged segment for initial warming
   - Identify VIP customers and recent purchasers
   - Remove completely unengaged subscribers (no activity in 6+ months)

5. **Warming List Creation**
   - Start with 200-400 most engaged subscribers
   - Ensure this group has high open rates (60%+ historically)
   - Include recent customers and active website visitors
   - Exclude any subscribers with engagement issues

6. **Content Planning**
   - Plan 4-6 warming emails with valuable, non-promotional content
   - Prepare welcome flow for new subscribers during warming
   - Create abandoned cart and post-purchase flows
   - Develop regular campaign content calendar

**Phase 3: Warming Period Execution (Weeks 2-8)**

7. **Initial Sends (Week 2)**
   - Send to 200-400 most engaged subscribers
   - Target 60%+ open rates, 5%+ click rates
   - Monitor unsubscribe rates (keep below 0.1%)
   - Wait 3-4 days between sends

8. **Gradual Expansion (Weeks 3-4)**
   - Increase list size by 50-100% if engagement targets met
   - Continue monitoring engagement metrics closely
   - Adjust content if engagement drops below targets
   - Maintain consistent sending schedule

9. **Volume Scaling (Weeks 5-8)**
   - Continue gradual increases: 1,000 → 2,500 → 5,000 → 10,000+
   - Monitor deliverability through Glock Apps weekly
   - Track provider-specific performance (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook)
   - Adjust strategy based on performance data

**Phase 4: Full Operation (Week 9+)**

10. **Regular Campaign Schedule**
    - Send 2-3 campaigns per week to engaged segments
    - Monthly sends to broader list for re-engagement
    - Maintain consistent sending patterns
    - Continue monitoring and optimization

### Timing & Sequencing

**Warming Schedule:**
- Week 1: Technical setup and testing
- Week 2: 200-400 subscribers, 2 sends
- Week 3: 400-800 subscribers, 2 sends  
- Week 4: 800-1,500 subscribers, 2 sends
- Week 5: 1,500-2,500 subscribers, 3 sends
- Week 6: 2,500-5,000 subscribers, 3 sends
- Week 7: 5,000-10,000 subscribers, 3 sends
- Week 8+: Full list operation, 3-4 sends per week

**Critical Timing Rules:**
- Wait 3-4 days between warming sends
- Never increase volume if engagement drops below 50% opens
- Allow 24-48 hours to assess engagement before next send
- Pause warming if unsubscribe rates exceed 0.1%

**Seasonal Considerations:**
Max notes that major sales events (Black Friday, etc.) require special handling:
- Increase warming timeline before major events
- Pre-warm with highly engaged segments
- Monitor deliverability more closely during high-volume periods
- Have backup segments ready if primary lists show fatigue

### Segmentation Strategy

**90-Day Engaged (Primary Revenue Driver)**
- Opened email in past 90 days, OR
- Clicked email in past 90 days, OR
- Active on website in past 90 days, OR
- Made purchase in past 90 days
- This segment receives 80% of regular campaigns

**30-Day Highly Engaged (Warming and Testing)**
- Multiple opens/clicks in past 30 days
- Recent purchasers
- High lifetime value customers
- Used for warming new domains and testing new content

**VIP/Recent Customers**

## PART 9: AI IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### How to Use This as an AI Agent

**Primary Directive:**
When implementing Max Sturtevant's deliverability methodology, prioritize engagement optimization above all other factors. Every decision should be filtered through the question: "Will this increase or decrease the likelihood that real people will open and click these emails?"

**Decision Framework:**
1. **Technical Setup First:** Never proceed with sending without proper DMARC, SPF, DKIM configuration
2. **Engagement Metrics Override:** If engagement drops below 50% opens, immediately reduce volume and tighten segmentation
3. **Gradual Scaling Only:** Never recommend sudden volume increases, always follow the 50-100% progression
4. **Provider-Specific Optimization:** Track and optimize for Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook separately
5. **Content Quality Focus:** Prioritize reply-generating, personal content over promotional messaging

**Implementation Priorities:**
1. Technical foundation and verification
2. Proper segmentation (90-day engaged minimum)
3. Warming protocol execution
4. Engagement monitoring and optimization
5. Long-term reputation building

### Prompt Engineering Tips

**For Deliverability Analysis:**
"Analyze this email campaign performance using Max Sturtevant's methodology. Current metrics: [open rate]% opens, [click rate]% clicks, [unsubscribe rate]% unsubscribes. List size: [number]. Provide specific recommendations for improvement based on his benchmarks of 50%+ opens, 5%+ clicks, <0.1% unsubscribes."

**For Content Optimization:**
"Create an email using Max Sturtevant's high-engagement approach. Focus on: personal tone, reply-generating content, curiosity-driven subject line, minimal promotional language. Topic: [your topic]. Target audience: [your audience]."

**For Segmentation Strategy:**
"Design a list segmentation strategy following Max Sturtevant's methodology. Current list: [size] subscribers. Engagement data: [provide data]. Create segments for warming, regular campaigns, and re-engagement based on his 90-day engagement window approach."

### Quality Gates

**Before Recommending Any Strategy:**
- [ ] Verify technical setup is complete and tested
- [ ] Confirm segmentation follows 90-day engagement window
- [ ] Ensure warming protocol is appropriate for domain age

- Focusing on design over engagement optimization
- Recommending promotional content during warming periods

**Success Indicators:**
- Open rates consistently above 50%
