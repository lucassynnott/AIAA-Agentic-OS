# SKILL BIBLE: VSL Video Editing & Post-Production Mastery

## Executive Summary

Video Sales Letter (VSL) editing is the critical bridge between raw recorded footage and a high-converting sales asset. This comprehensive skill bible covers the complete post-production workflow for transforming raw VSL recordings into polished, professional videos that maximize conversions through strategic editing, pacing optimization, and professional enhancements.

The editing process involves five distinct phases: Assembly Edit (rough cut), Fine Cut (detailed editing), Enhancements (professional polish), Audio Enhancement (crystal-clear sound), and Final Review & QA. Each phase builds upon the previous one, systematically transforming amateur-looking footage into a credible, engaging sales tool. The goal is to enhance authenticity while removing distractions, maintaining viewer engagement through dynamic pacing, and ensuring technical quality that reflects professional credibility.

This skill is essential for anyone creating VSL funnels, as poor editing can destroy conversions regardless of script quality. The investment of 6-8 hours in professional editing can transform a VSL that generates minimal results into one that produces $50K+ in revenue. The key is balancing professional polish with authentic delivery, using editing to enhance rather than overshadow the core message.

## Core Principles

### 1. Pacing is Everything
Dynamic pacing keeps viewers engaged throughout the VSL. Remove unnecessary pauses (keep 0.5-1 second between sentences), tighten transitions, and vary rhythm based on content section. Intro/hook should be fast-paced and punchy, problem sections can slow down to let pain sink in, solution sections should build excitement with varied pacing, proof sections need steady rhythm, and CTAs should slow slightly for clarity.

### 2. Authenticity Over Perfection
Light mistakes humanize the presenter and build trust. Don't over-edit to the point of sterility. Remove major stumbles and long pauses, but leave minor imperfections that make the presenter relatable. The goal is professional polish, not robotic perfection.

### 3. Audio Quality First Priority
Poor audio kills conversions faster than poor video quality. Invest significant time in noise reduction, EQ, compression, and level matching. Target -16 LUFS for web video standards. Clean, consistent audio is non-negotiable for credibility.

### 4. Maintain Visual Congruency
Energy and tone must remain consistent throughout the VSL. Use B-roll strategically to cover jump cuts while maintaining visual interest. Color grade consistently across all clips. Ensure all enhancements (text overlays, lower thirds, background music) support rather than distract from the core message.

### 5. Test Before Scaling
Get feedback from target audience members before finalizing. Show to teammates, potential customers, and non-expert friends. If 2+ people mention the same issue, fix it. Don't over-obsess on minor details - perfect is the enemy of done.

### 6. Platform-Specific Optimization
Different platforms require different approaches. Landing page VSLs can be 3-5 minutes with subtle background music and professional polish. Social media versions need burned-in captions, faster pacing, stronger hooks, and shorter duration (1-2 minutes max).

### 7. Enhancement Without Distraction
All enhancements (music, text overlays, B-roll, effects) should support the message, never overpower it. Background music should be barely audible (-28dB). Text overlays should be used sparingly (3-5 times max). Avoid cheesy transitions or effects that scream "amateur."

### 8. Data-Driven Iteration
Use analytics to optimize future edits. Track play rate, engagement graphs, drop-off points, and conversion rates. If viewers drop off in the first 10 seconds, the hook needs strengthening. If drop-off occurs around 2-3 minutes, the VSL is too long or pacing is too slow.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Edit Preparation (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Review All Raw Footage
Create comprehensive edit notes document identifying best takes, sections to use, mistakes to cut, and technical issues to address. Example format:
```
VSL EDIT NOTES - [Project Name]
RAW FOOTAGE:
- Take 1: 00:00-08:45 (good energy, fumbled at 3:20)
- Take 2: 00:00-09:10 (best take, use as primary)
- Take 3: 00:00-08:30 (backup, tired energy)

SECTIONS TO USE:
- Intro: Take 2 (00:00-01:15)
- Problem: Take 2 (01:15-03:45)
- Solution: Take 2 (03:45-05:20)
- Proof: Take 2 (05:20-07:30)
- CTA: Take 2 (07:30-09:10)
```

#### Step 2: Organize Project Assets
Create structured folder system:
```
/[ProjectName]_VSL_Edit
  /01_Raw_Footage
  /02_Audio
  /03_Graphics
  /04_B-Roll
  /05_Project_Files
  /06_Exports
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Edit Project
Configure DaVinci Resolve with proper settings:
- Timeline Resolution: 1920x1080 HD
- Frame Rate: 30fps
- Color Space: Rec.709 Gamma 2.4
- Audio Sample Rate: 48000 Hz, 24-bit

### Phase 2: Assembly Edit - Rough Cut (1 hour)

#### Step 4: Import and Organize Footage
Import all raw footage into Media Pool. Drag best take to timeline. Scrub through and identify major sections according to VSL structure.

#### Step 5: Mark In/Out Points and Build Timeline
For each VSL section, mark in/out points using I and O keys. Structure timeline:
- [00:00-01:00] Intro/Hook
- [01:00-02:30] Problem Agitation
- [02:30-03:30] Solution Introduction
- [03:30-06:00] Proof Stack
- [06:00-07:30] Process/How It Works
- [07:30-08:00] Objection Handling
- [08:00-09:00] CTA/Next Steps

#### Step 6: Remove Major Mistakes
Use blade tool (B key) to cut out:
- Stumbles and word fumbles
- Long pauses (>2 seconds)
- "Um", "uh", filler words
- False starts
- Off-script tangents

#### Step 7: Assembly Review
Play full timeline start to finish. Check for all sections present, logical flow maintained, major mistakes removed, and appropriate target length (3-5 minutes for most VSLs).

### Phase 3: Fine Cut - Detailed Edit (2 hours)

#### Step 8: Tighten Pacing
Remove dead air using specific timing guidelines:
- Between words in sentence: 0.2-0.3 seconds
- Between sentences: 0.5-0.8 seconds
- Before important points: 1-1.5 seconds
- Section transitions: 1.5-2 seconds

#### Step 9: Smooth Jump Cuts
Address visual jumps using multiple techniques:

**Option A: B-Roll Overlay**
- Add screen recordings, animated charts, stock footage, product images, or text overlays over jump cuts
- Cover 1-2 seconds around the jump
- Ensure B-roll supports the audio content

**Option B: Camera Angle Changes**
- Switch between multiple camera angles if available
- Creates intentional camera movement that covers the cut

**Option C: Subtle Zoom/Crop**
- Duplicate clip and zoom in 10-15%
- Creates "camera push" effect
- Use sparingly (max 2-3 times per VSL)

#### Step 10: Add Slide Transitions
Create smooth transitions between slide changes:
- Use cross dissolve sparingly (0.5-0.75 seconds)
- Add subtle zoom or pan to slides for dynamic feel
- Most transitions should be straight cuts

#### Step 11: Match Audio Levels
Ensure consistent volume throughout:
- Normalize audio levels to -16 LUFS
- Manually adjust quiet sections (+3dB to +6dB)
- Remove plosives (P/B pops) with volume keyframes
- Apply compression (3:1 ratio, -20dB threshold)

### Phase 4: Enhancements - Professional Polish (1-2 hours)

#### Step 12: Add Opening Title Card
Create 2-3 second branded opening:
- Company name and "Presents"
- Logo placement
- Brand colors
- Fade in/out transitions

#### Step 13: Create Lower Third (Name Tag)
Display presenter credentials:
- Show 5-8 seconds into VSL
- Name and title/company
- Clean sans-serif font (48pt name, 32pt title)
- Fade in/out (12 frames each)

#### Step 14: Add Strategic Text Overlays
Reinforce key statements (use sparingly - 3-5 times max):
- Important statistics: "847 Agencies Served"
- Key claims: "3X Your Revenue in 90 Days"
- Bullet points and CTAs
- Large, readable font (72-96pt)
- High contrast with stroke outline
- 3-5 second duration with animated entrance

#### Step 15: Incorporate Background Music
Add subtle audio enhancement:
- Select corporate/inspiring instrumental tracks
- Volume at -28dB (barely audible)
- Fade in (2 seconds) and out (3 seconds)
- Apply ducking so music lowers when speaking
- Skip if unsure about music choice

#### Step 16: Insert B-Roll for Visual Interest
Add supporting visuals:
- Screen recordings during case studies
- Stock footage for concepts
- Motion graphics for statistics
- Client logos and testimonials
- Change every 5-8 seconds for engagement
- 3-8 seconds per B-roll clip

#### Step 17: Color Grade for Consistency
Apply basic color correction:
- Auto color balance first
- Slight contrast boost with S-curve
- Saturation boost (+5 to +10)
- Apply grade to all clips for consistency
- Keep subtle - avoid "cinematic" looks for B2B

### Phase 5: Audio Enhancement (1 hour)

#### Step 18: Noise Reduction
Clean up background noise:
- Use DaVinci Resolve's built-in noise reduction
- Sample noise from silent sections
- Apply 12-18dB reduction
- Alternative: Export to Audacity for advanced cleanup

#### Step 19: EQ for Voice Clarity
Enhance voice presence:
- High-pass filter at 80Hz (remove rumble)
- Cut 200-400Hz (-3dB) to remove muddiness
- Boost 3-5kHz (+3dB) for presence/clarity
- Slight boost at 10kHz (+2dB) for air

#### Step 20: De-Essing
Reduce harsh "S" sounds:
- Target 6000-8000Hz frequency range
- Threshold: -20dB
- Ratio: 6:1
- Adjust until sibilance softened

#### Step 21: Final Compression and Limiting
Ensure even, professional loudness:
- Compressor: 3:1 ratio, -20dB threshold, 6ms attack, 60ms release
- Limiter: -1dB threshold to prevent clipping
- Target integrated loudness: -16 LUFS

### Phase 6: Final Review & QA (30 minutes)

#### Step 22: Technical Quality Check
Verify all technical elements:
- Audio clear with no distortion or clipping
- Consistent audio levels throughout
- Video in focus entire time
- No black frames or glitches
- All B-roll placed correctly
- Text overlays readable and properly timed
- Color grade consistent across clips

#### Step 23: Content Quality Review
Ensure message effectiveness:
- Opening hook grabs attention (first 10 seconds)
- Logical story flow (problem → solution → proof → CTA)
- Dynamic pacing (not too slow or rushed)
- All key proof points included
- Crystal clear CTA
- No awkward long pauses
- Natural-feeling jump cuts
- Consistent energy throughout

#### Step 24: External Feedback
Get fresh perspective from:
- Teammate/partner for error catching
- Target customer for message resonance
- Non-expert friend for clarity testing

Ask specific questions:
- Did you stay engaged the whole time?
- What part was confusing (if any)?
- Did the CTA make sense?
- Would you book a call after watching?
- Any technical issues noticed?

### Phase 7: Export & Delivery (30 minutes)

#### Step 25: Export with Optimal Settings
Configure DaVinci Resolve Deliver page:
- Format: MP4, H.264 codec
- Resolution: 1920x1080, 30fps
- Video bitrate: 15000 Kbps
- Audio: AAC, 48kHz, 256 kbps
- Quality: Automatic or restricted bitrate

#### Step 26: Verify Export Quality
Test exported video:
- Plays smoothly without glitches
- Audio synced with video
- Quality meets standards
- Correct length and content

#### Step 27: Create Multiple Versions
Export variants for different uses:
- High-quality master (25000 Kbps) for archive
- Web-optimized (10000-15000 Kbps) for landing pages
- Social media versions (different aspect ratios)
- Low-bandwidth version (5000 Kbps, 720p) if needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Editing Pitfalls
- **Making it feel sterile or robotic**: Leave minor imperfections that humanize the presenter
- **Using excessive effects or transitions**: Stick to simple cuts and subtle dissolves
- **Over-compressing audio**: Can create pumping artifacts and unnatural sound
- **Cutting too aggressively**: Maintain natural speech rhythm and breathing
- **Adding too many text overlays**: Becomes distracting and amateur-looking
- **Using inappropriate music**: Wrong genre or too loud destroys professional credibility
- **Color grading too heavily**: Avoid "cinematic" looks that feel out of place for business content
- **Removing all personality**: Some stumbles and natural speech patterns build trust

### Technical Quality Errors
- **Ignoring audio levels**: Inconsistent volume throughout video kills viewer experience
- **Poor export settings**: Low bitrate creates compression artifacts and poor quality
- **Mismatched frame rates**: Causes stuttering playback and sync issues
- **Incorrect color space**: Results in color shifts between editing and final viewing
- **Clipping audio**: Distorted audio from levels too high destroys credibility
- **Forgetting to normalize**: Quiet audio forces viewers to strain to hear
- **Using wrong aspect ratio**: Doesn't fit intended platform properly
- **Skipping quality check**: Exporting without reviewing can miss critical errors

### Content Structure Mistakes
- **Weak opening hook**: Losing viewers in first 10 seconds due to slow start
- **Inconsistent pacing**: Sudden rhythm changes that feel jarring
- **Poor section transitions**: Abrupt topic changes without smooth bridges
- **Hiding the presenter**: People buy from people, not faceless voices
- **Unclear CTA**: Viewers don't know what action to take next
- **Too much B-roll**: Overwhelming visuals that distract from message
- **Wrong video length**: Too long loses attention, too short doesn't build enough value
- **Missing proof elements**: Claims without evidence reduce credibility

### Platform-Specific Errors
- **No captions for social**: 85% of social video watched without sound
- **Wrong aspect ratio**: Square video on landscape platform looks unprofessional
- **Inappropriate length**: 8-minute VSL on Instagram won't perform
- **Missing platform CTAs**: Each platform has different optimal call-to-action approaches
- **Ignoring autoplay policies**: Not optimizing for muted autoplay on social platforms
- **Generic content**: Not adapting message for platform-specific audiences
- **Poor thumbnail**: First impression determines click-through rates
- **Forgetting mobile optimization**: Most viewing happens on mobile devices

### Post-Production Workflow Errors
- **Skipping backup**: Losing project files or source footage
- **Poor file organization**: Wasting time searching for assets
- **Not saving incrementally**: Losing hours of work due to crashes
- **Rushing final review**: Missing obvious errors that hurt credibility
- **Skipping external feedback**: Missing issues that fresh eyes would catch
- **Not testing on target devices**: Video looks different on various screens
- **Forgetting version control**: Confusion about which is the final version
- **Poor file naming**: Difficulty identifying correct files later
