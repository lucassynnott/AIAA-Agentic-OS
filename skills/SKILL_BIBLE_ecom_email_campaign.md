## Core Principles

### 1. Frequency Over Perfection
Send 3-4 campaigns per week consistently rather than waiting for perfect content. Data shows that increased frequency (with good content) leads to 14% higher open rates, 75% higher click rates, and consistently better conversion rates while unsubscribe rates remain flat or decrease.

### 2. Value-First Content Strategy
Maintain an 80/20 split between educational/nurture content and promotional content. This 5:1 ratio builds trust, provides value, and prevents subscriber fatigue while positioning your brand as helpful rather than purely transactional.

### 3. Engaged Audience Targeting
Only send campaigns to engaged segments (opened, clicked, or purchased within 60-90 days) rather than your entire list. This approach improves deliverability, engagement rates, and overall campaign performance.

### 4. Mobile-First Design
Design every email with mobile as the primary consideration since 60%+ of emails are opened on mobile devices. This means single-column layouts, large touch targets (44x44px minimum), and scannable content structure.

### 5. Skimmability and Clarity
Structure all content for quick scanning with short paragraphs (2-3 sentences), bullet points, bold key phrases, subheadings, and strategic use of white space. Readers should understand the main message within 5-10 seconds.

### 6. Data-Driven Optimization
Use metrics (open rates, click rates, click-to-open rates, conversion rates, revenue per recipient) to continuously improve performance. Test one variable at a time and apply learnings to future campaigns.

### 7. Brand Consistency
Maintain consistent visual branding, tone, and messaging across all campaigns to reinforce brand recognition and trust. Every email should feel like an extension of your website and brand experience.

### 8. Clear Action Orientation
Every campaign must have a clear, singular primary call-to-action that tells subscribers exactly what to do next. Multiple CTAs are acceptable for longer emails, but one should be primary and obvious.
