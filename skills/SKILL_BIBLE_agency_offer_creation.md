# SKILL BIBLE: Agency Offer Creation Masterclass

> Source: Matthew Larsen (1000x Leads) - Scaled agency from $0 to $900K/month, 3 agency exits
> Context: Complete offer creation system for B2B service businesses

---

## Executive Summary

The offer is the highest-leverage element in any B2B business. A better offer means higher click-through rates, opt-in rates, book call rates, show rates, and close rates. This skill bible provides the complete framework for creating offers that actually convert cold traffic into paying clients.

---

## The Core Problem

Most companies don't have a real offer. They rely on:
- Referrals and networking
- Self-limiting beliefs ("offers feel scammy")
- Amateur status (didn't know they needed one)
- Weak offers ("I'll manage your ads" is not an offer)

**Example of Not an Offer:**
> "I'm going to manage your Facebook ads for your e-commerce brand"

**Example of a Real Offer:**
> "We'll take your 3 best ad creatives and remake them with 50+ different avatars to expand your audience reach"

---

## Case Study: Facebook Ad Agency

**Situation:**
- Grew to $8M/year through referrals only
- Wanted to sell but couldn't attract cold traffic clients
- No buyers took them seriously

**Offer Created:**
- Take 3 best ad creatives
- Remake with 50+ different avatars (demographics)
- White man, black man, Asian man, Latino man, Arab man
- Same for women
- Old, middle-aged, young
- Different body types

**Why It Worked:**
- People buy from people who look like them
- Proven ads guaranteed to work (already working)
- Expands delivery to broader audiences
- Appeals ONLY to qualified e-commerce stores (need 3 great creatives already)

**Result:** One client went from $30M to $100M in 18 months using this service.

## The Offer Framework

### Step 1: Determine ICP

Base your ICP on 80% of your average customers:
- Job title
- Demographics (race, gender, age)
- Revenue range
- Location
- Niche
- Common attributes

### Step 2: Brainstorm 10 Offers

**Critical Rule:** Offer must appeal to target audience AND ONLY to them.

Don't want: Attracts target audience + everyone below them (ruins pixel data, wastes time)

### Step 3: Test Before Building

- Run ads to 10 different offers
- Don't build the actual offer yet
- Just landing page + opt-in
- Measure opt-in rates
- Collect data on what actually works (not what you think will work)

## Two Golden Rules for Offers

### Rule 1: Things People Already Buy

> "Just because you are unique doesn't mean you are useful."

**The Fork Analogy:** A fork with bent prongs is unique but useless.

**Case Study: Business Loan Agency**
- **Before:** Selling retainers to manage Facebook/Google ads ($120K/month)
- **Problem:** Industry standard is buying leads and cold calling, not retainers
- **After:** Switched to pay-per-lead model ($800K/month in 3 months)

**Do This:**
1. Write down offer choices
2. Cross-reference with things people already buy
3. Replace anything too new/unproven
4. Research what people like/dislike about past vendors
5. Finish with 10 ideas people already buy that you can do better

### Rule 2: Things People MUST Have

> "The best hack in the entire world is to sell stuff that people must buy."

**Examples of "Must Have":**
- Auto insurance (legally mandated in US)
- Medical insurance (avoid medical bankruptcy)
- Facebook ads for e-commerce (functionally required)
- Email marketing for e-commerce (functionally required)

**Why This Matters:**
- Built-in urgency
- They're buying from someone no matter what
- You're competing for business, not creating demand
- Shorter sales cycles

## The 7 Types of Offers

### Why Multiple Offers?

**Problem:** 97% of leads are never qualified to buy your main service.

| Unqualified Reason | Solution |
|-------------------|----------|
| Price (can't afford) | Course, digital product |
| Fit (don't need you) | Referral fee |
| Timing (not ready) | Program, nurture |

### The Complete Offer Suite

1. **Main Recurring Service** - Cash machine, where all money is made
2. **Intro Offer** - Workhorse for client acquisition
3. **Course** - Do it yourself (10% of service price)
4. **Program** - Done with you (33% of service price)
5. **Referral Fees** - Adjacent services
6. **Digital Products** - $97 or less, no fulfillment
7. **Affiliate Offers** - Software they'll buy anyway

### The Math That Changes Everything

**Before (Service Only):**
- $1M revenue @ 25% margin = $250K profit

**After (Full Suite):**
- $1M service @ 25% margin = $250K
- $1M other offers @ 90% margin = $900K
- **Total: $1.15M profit**

Same double revenue, but 5x profit increase.

## Offer Type: Main Recurring Service

### Improving LTV (Without Changing Service)

**Case Study: Email Marketing Agency**
- Stuck at $350K/month (churn = acquisition)
- Implemented 5 fixes:

1. **Clean Onboarding with Quick Wins**
   - 5 immediate wins to tide them over
   - Reduces buyer remorse

2. **Daily Communication**
   - Morning: What we're doing today
   - Evening: What we did

3. **Daily Reporting** (not weekly)
   - Day over day
   - Week over week
   - Month over month
   - Today vs. starting point

4. **3-Month Planning**
   - Always have 3 months of work scheduled
   - Viewed as partner, not vendor

5. **Price Testing**
   - Increase 20% every 4 clients
   - Continue until close rate drops to 15%
   - 15% close rate on cold = optimal pricing

**Result:** Churn dropped from 26% to 9%

---

## Offer Type: Intro Offer

### Why Intro Offers Work

**The Risk Problem:**
- Financial risk (losing money paid)
- Operational risk (you screw up their business)
- Reputation risk (marketing manager gets fired)

Rich prospects calculate real risk, not just fee risk.

### Ideal Intro Offer Structure

- As close to $2,500 as possible
- Minimum $250/hour effective rate
- Strong guarantee (can't do on main service)
- Gets foot in the door with large clients

**Case Study: Cold Email Agency**
- Before: $15K upfront for 3 months = high friction
- After: No-cost pilot (1 month free, $500 deposit)
- Result: $1M to $3M in 5 months
- Response rate increased 6.2%
- CTR increased 400%

---

## Offer Type: Course

### Why You Need a Course

**The Competitor Training Objection:**
> "I don't want to train my competitors"

**Reality:** 
- 97% can't buy your service anyway
- Course becomes massive social proof
- Community becomes referral source
- Dual purpose: Train your own employees

**Case Study: YouTube Editing Agency**
- Before: "100% of leads aren't YouTubers" (actually just too small)
- After: Packaged SOPs into $997 course
- Result: 1/3 of revenue from course
- Course customers become service clients through referrals

---

## Offer Type: Program

### Why Programs Work

15-20% of market wants:
- Not done for you
- Not do it yourself
- Done WITH you

**Program Components:**
- Course content
- Community (Telegram, Slack, Discord, School)
- Weekly calls
- Active founder participation

**Pricing:** ~33% of main service

---

## Offer Type: Referral Fees

### The Underutilized Goldmine

**Case Study: Addiction Treatment Lead Gen**
- Only worked with $50K+ budgets
- Referred smaller clients to SEO/Google Ads partner
- Partner pays $5K per close
- Cost per call: ~$150
- Partner close rate: 10%
- CAC: $1,500
- Revenue: $5K
- **3x ROAS just from referrals**

**How to Build:**
1. List every adjacent service
2. List 10 potential partners per service
3. List cheaper alternatives to your service
4. Create referral agreement document
5. Add to onboarding process

---

## Offer Type: Digital Products

### The Break-Even Machine

**Goal:** Acquire customers for free, upsell later

**Requirements:**
- Templates work best (not info)
- Valuable to ALL levels of market
- No fulfillment (product, not service)
- Price: $97 (psychological barrier at $100)

**Case Study: CRO Agency**
- Sold 100 landing page templates for $97
- CEOs doing 9 figures bought them
- Beginners bought them
- Broke even on acquisition, upsold to services

---

## Offer Type: Affiliate

### Hidden MRR Machine

**Strategy:**
- Include affiliate links in every guide
- Every digital product
- Every blog post
- Every lead magnet

**Example:** Adrian Morrison
- Front-end ad offer: AI builds their Shopify store
- Back-end: $100K+/month in affiliate commissions from Shopify
