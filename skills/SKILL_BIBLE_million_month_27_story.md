# SKILL BIBLE: Making $1 Million Per Month at 27 (Daniel Fazio's Complete Journey)

## Executive Summary

This is Daniel Fazio's complete entrepreneurial journey from age 20 to 27, documenting the exact path from $0 to $1,000,000/month in revenue ($400K/month profit at 40% margins). Unlike most "how I got rich" stories from coaching gurus, **70% of Fazio's revenue comes from done-for-you services and software** (Client Ascension, ListKit, Olympia), not info products - making this genuinely operational knowledge from someone executing at scale.

The core thesis: **You need multiple products to break past revenue plateaus**. Most businesses get stuck at $200-400K/month with one offer. The unlock is creating downsells, cross-sells, upsells, and entirely new products to sell to your existing customer base - because **the most probable person to buy from you is someone who already bought from you**.

This skill bible extracts the predictable failure patterns at each revenue stage ($0-10K, $10-50K, $50-200K, $200K-1M+), the three immutable ways to acquire clients (content, outreach, ads - that's it), and the psychological blocks that sabotage growth at each level.

**Key Quote:** "A lot of money is simply an aggregation of a bunch of custom little things. This is what you need to do. You're a one-trick pony. What you did is you found one offer with product-market fit and then you built a business around one offer and that was it. You need to do this multiple times throughout your life."

## Section 1: The Complete Journey Timeline (Age 20-27)

### Phase 1: Age 20 - Amazon FBA ($0-$10K/month)

**First Real Business:** Amazon FBA
- Just out of college
- Made "a little bit of money"
- Learned e-commerce fundamentals
- Realized physical products weren't scalable for him

**Lesson:** First business is about learning, not riches

---

### Phase 2: Age 20-21 - Facebook Ads for Local Businesses ($10-15K/month)

**Service:** Facebook ads and local business marketing

**The Pivot:**
"Quickly learned that local businesses actually suck."

**Why Local Failed:**
- Small budgets
- High churn
- Constant hand-holding
- Geographic limitations
- Can't scale

**Key Insight:** Some niches are mathematically unscalable

---

### Phase 3: Age 21-22 - Instagram Growth Agency ($12K/month)

**The Breakthrough:** Selling to anyone in the world (not just local)

**Service:** Instagram growth
- Got to $12K/month
- Acquired all clients via cold email
- Discovered cold email as client acquisition channel

**The Crash:**
Algorithm update destroyed the business overnight

**Critical Lesson:** Platform-dependent businesses are fragile

**The Silver Lining:**
"But I had got all the clients with cold email..."
This realization led to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4: Age 22-23 - Cold Email as a Service ($20K/month)

**The Pivot:**
"I started selling cold email as a service to other businesses, got that to about $20K/month."

**Why This Worked:**
- Not platform-dependent
- Universal need (every business needs clients)
- Scalable model
- High margins

**Concurrent Activity:**
Created Twitter account "@ColdEmailWizard"
- Built audience teaching cold email
- Positioned as expert
- Set up Phase 5

---

### Phase 5: Age 23-24 - Cold Email Course + Software ($50-100K/month)

**Digital Product Launch:**
- Created "Cold Email Mastery" course
- Sold to 8,000 people
- Generated substantial cash

**The Psychopath Saver:**
"Had a bunch of money that I was saving up at this point because I'm a psychopath and saving like literally everything I make."

**Software Pivot:**
Started replicating software apps he recommended in the course
- Built 6 software companies
- Most failed
- Cash reserves allowed for experimentation

**Key Lesson:** Multiple product attempts required. Most will fail.

---

### Phase 6: Age 24-25 - Client Ascension Launch ($200K/month)

**The Partnership:**
Met three business partners: Andre, Christian, Dan

**The Company:** Client Ascension
- B2B agency coaching/consulting
- Help agencies scale with cold email and systems
- Got to $200K/month

**Previous Video Milestone:**
Made video at $2.5M total by age 25 ($200K/month run rate)

**The Plateau:**
"We kind of got stuck between $200-400K a month. It just really couldn't break past there."

**Why They Got Stuck:**
Only selling one thing (Client Ascension)

**Critical Insight:** Single product businesses plateau

---

### Phase 7: Age 25-27 - Multiple Products ($1M/month)

**The Breakthrough:** Adding multiple products

**Product 1: Client Ascension** (Coaching/Consulting)
- Original offer
- Continuous case study generation
- 1,000+ clients helped
- Consistent growth through social proof flywheel

**Product 2: ListKit** (Software - $500K/month)
- Sells leads for cold email campaigns
- $0 to $100K MRR in 90 days
- Now over $500K/month alone
- Most profitable product

**Partners:** Andre, Christian, Dan, Oliver (early Client Ascension member)

**Product 3: Olympia** (Ads Coaching)
- Help businesses at $30K/month scale with paid ads
- Teaches the paid ads system they use for ListKit
- Just launched (contributing to $1M total)

**December 2024:** $1,000,000/month achieved

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- ListKit (software): $500K+/month (50%+)
- Client Ascension (coaching): $300-400K/month (30-40%)
- Olympia (ads coaching): $100-200K/month (10-20%)

**Critical Point:**
"Most of our money is not from coaching. Coaching is just like a cash flow thing to facilitate our lifestyle to be able to grow this software company so that we can grow that super massive and sell it for a bunch of money. That's the play here."

---

## Section 2: The Profit Margin Truth (Addressing the Haters)

### The Comment They Always Get

"But what's the profit margin?"

**Fazio's Response:**

"The answer is right now it's about 40%, but I could immediately send that up to 70 or 80% but trade off growth.

You have to understand that when you're growing a company you trade profit margin right now in exchange for growth later on so that you can make a higher absolute amount of profit later on.

This is what people don't understand. They functionally do not get the concept of reinvesting profits into a business so that the revenue grows higher so that the absolute amount of profit goes up way later on."

### The Math

**Current State:**
- Revenue: $1M/month
- Profit margin: 40%
- Profit: $400K/month

**Could Do (But Won't):**
- Revenue: $1M/month
- Profit margin: 70-80%
- Profit: $700-800K/month
- Growth: Stagnant

**Future State (The Goal):**
- Revenue: $3M/month (3X growth)
- Profit margin: 40%
- Profit: $1.2M/month (3X absolute profit)

### The Principle

**Trade temporary margin for future scale:**
```
$1M × 70% = $700K profit (no growth)
VS
$3M × 40% = $1.2M profit (with growth)
```

**Reinvestment Categories:**
- Hiring (team expansion)
- Ad spend (customer acquisition)
- Software development (product improvement)
- Content creation (marketing)
- Systems building (infrastructure)

**The Misunderstanding:**

"The dude in the comments who's never run a company in his life" doesn't understand you're optimizing for absolute profit in 2-3 years, not margin today.

---

## Section 3: The Multiple Products Unlock (Breaking $200K-400K Plateau)

### The Stuck Point

**What Happened:**
"Before, we were kind of stuck between $200-400K a month. It just really couldn't break past there. The reason why is we were only really selling one thing which was Client Ascension."

**Why One Product Plateaus:**
- Limited market size for that one offer
- Churn happens (clients leave)
- Can't sell anything else to churned customers
- New customer acquisition is expensive
- Hit ceiling of "number of new customers per month"

### The Breakthrough Insight

**The Core Lesson:**

"If you really want to substantially increase revenue, you need more products and services to sell because you have to understand if you're selling hundreds or thousands of customers they come in, they churn from something else, but that doesn't mean that they're not going to buy something else. They WILL buy something else."

### The Mathematical Truth

**Most Probable Buyer:**

"The most probable person on Earth to buy something from you is somebody who has already bought something from you."

**Why This Matters:**

| Customer Type | Acquisition Cost | Conversion Probability | Effort Required |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Cold traffic (never heard of you) | High ($2K+ CAC) | Low (5-30%) | Maximum |
| Warm traffic (knows you) | Medium | Medium (30-50%) | Moderate |
| **Past customer** | **Low ($0-500)** | **High (50-80%)** | **Minimum** |

### The Leaving-Money-on-Table Problem

**Scenario:**
- You have one offer ($3K/month retainer)
- You sign 100 customers over 2 years
- Average retention: 6 months
- 50 customers have churned

**What Most Do:**
- Let those 50 churned customers disappear
- Focus 100% on new customer acquisition
- Ignore the warm list

**What You Should Do:**
- Those 50 churned customers already know/like/trust you
- Create additional offers (downsells, different services, higher ticket, lower ticket)
- Sell to warm list
- Conversion rate: 50-80% vs 20% for cold traffic

**The Math:**
- 50 churned customers
- 50% conversion on new $2K offer
- 25 new customers at $2K = $50K/month added revenue
- CAC for this: ~$0 (email/DM to warm list)

**Fazio's Example:**

"We started adding a bunch of other things. There's also peripheral products like some low ticket products we've sold. We've done some in-person events that we sell tickets to. And that helped drive revenue up as well."

---

## Section 4: The Unconscious Shame Around Money (Why People Don't Sell to Past Customers)

### The Psychological Block

**Fazio's Observation:**

"The reason why they don't approach old clients is because they're scared of the results that they gave to a client. They don't want to confront somebody who has given them money because you have this unconscious shame around having received money from somebody.

You have a bad relationship with money. You think that when somebody gave you money there's like a feeling of shame associated with it, which is not correct at all. That's literally just not how it works.

Somebody bought something from you. They liked it. They'll continue to buy it.

When you have this unconscious shame around money, you are under the presumption that everybody who has given you money doesn't like you."

### The Internal Dialogue

**What You Think:**
- "They probably didn't get great results"
- "They're probably annoyed at me"
- "It would be awkward to reach out"
- "They'll think I'm just trying to get more money"
- "I don't want to bother them"

**The Reality:**
- They bought because they trusted you
- If they had a bad experience, they'd tell you
- They're open to hearing about new solutions
- They WANT you to offer more (saves them research time)
- Not reaching out is leaving money on table

### The Fix

**Reframe:**
1. They bought = They had a problem you could solve
2. They churned = That specific solution stopped fitting, not that you suck
3. They might have NEW problems = You might have NEW solutions
4. Reaching out = Providing value, not begging
5. If it's not a fit = They say no, world doesn't end

**Action:**
- Email every churned client with new offer
- No shame, just "Hey, we're now doing X, thought of you, interested?"
- 50-80% will reply positively
- 30-50% will buy

## Section 5: Revenue Stage Failure Modes (Predictable Obstacles)

### Stage 1: $0-10K/Month - The Product-Market Fit Problem

**What Stops You:**

**Failure Mode #1: Selling Things Without Proven Demand**

**Fazio's Example:**

"I was just on a consulting call with this guy. He was trying to sell marketing services to small hotel chains. I asked him: 'Do you know even ONE person on Earth, even one singular human, who sells marketing services to small hotel chains and became wealthy or makes literally any money at all? Do you know even a single person on the planet who has achieved this?'

He said no.

And I said: 'So what makes you think that you're going to be able to do this? Why is it that you thought you could just sell this random ass thing that you came up with to this random ass niche that is not proven that clearly nobody buys? Why do you think that you would be different?'"

**The Two Rules:**

**Rule 1: A client only buys something from you if there's a tangible result that they can expect to receive**
- Not vague "marketing services"
- Specific, concrete outcome
- They can visualize the before/after

**Rule 2: Saturation does not exist**
"You are more likely to make money in a saturated market than coming up with something brand new."

**Product-Market Fit Defined:**

"This is literally what the phrase product-market fit means. When a company says 'oh we found product-market fit and we were able to scale' that's literally what it means.

If you try to come up with random things, 'oh look at this revolutionary new idea,' there's no proven demand, there's no product-market fit. You just made something up that people don't buy. That's why you don't make any money. You're trying to sell something that people do not purchase."

**The Gravity Analogy:**

"It's like expecting if you jump off the third floor balcony of a building that you're not going to fall. If you jump off a balcony you DO fall. Gravity does exist.

So if you go into a market where there's no demand, it's like the demand does not exist. Money does not flow. Stop doing that. Stop jumping off the third floor balcony and thinking that you're different and gravity is not going to impact you.

Step into reality. If you want to get rich, sell the things that rich people are selling. It's really that simple."

**How to Find Proven Demand:**

1. Google "[your service] agency" or "[your service] consultant"
2. Find 3-5 people making $100K+/month
3. Look at their offer structure
4. Copy the STRUCTURE (not the copy)
5. Sell that

**You're Not Special:**

"You are not as special as you think you are. You're not going to make something work that's never been proven to work. Just sell the thing that people already buy. It's so much easier and this is just reality."

---

### Stage 2: $10K-50K/Month - The Fulfillment Bottleneck

**What Stops You:**

**Failure Mode #2: You're Doing All the Fulfillment**

**Fazio's Observation:**

"You will never get past $50K a month if you fail to develop a team of people who can do client fulfillment for you. I see this all of the time in Client Ascension.

There was a guy literally last week talking about 'hey look I'm trying to sign more clients' and that's not actually what he's trying to do because when I dig deeper into the situation it's like 'who's doing the fulfillment here?'

He's doing the fulfillment.

And you come to uncover that this guy has like hundreds of leads he could contact and is subconsciously sabotaging his sales calls because if he signs a new client he has to do hours and hours of manual work that he doesn't want to do.

So he's subconsciously sabotaging all of his sales calls and doesn't even want to sign a client."

**The Subconscious Sabotage Pattern:**

**What Happens:**
1. You do all fulfillment yourself
2. New client = 20 hours of work
3. You subconsciously don't want to work (nobody does)
4. You sabotage sales calls (unconsciously)
5. Close rate drops from 30% to 10%
6. You think: "Sales calls just aren't working"
7. Reality: You're sabotaging them

**The Universal Truth:**

"So much of this is subconscious and you have to recognize that literally no one wants to work at all. And this isn't saying 'oh you're lazy,' it's not what it is. I don't want to work either. Literally I don't want to sit and record this YouTube video. I actively did not want to do this.

Nobody wants to work.

You have to recognize what's occurring in your subconscious. If signing a client results in you needing to spend like 20 hours of work on something, you're just not going to want to sign the client. It's really that simple."

**The Mathematical Impossibility:**

"It is functionally and mathematically impossible for you to scale your offer or your company if you're signing clients and you are the one doing all of the work."

**The Non-Negotiable Solution:**

"You have to hire people. You need to become a leader of people who are capable of doing what you are doing.

There is literally no way that you get past this revenue level ($50K/month) if you do not do this. You have to understand this is not something that you get to skip past. It just is reality.

You DO need to hire people. You DO need to train them. You DO need to be active in the management of them and become a good leader and get them to be as good as you are on the fulfillment side.

There's literally no way around this. You have to do this."

**What Breaks at $50K Without Team:**
- You're working 80-100 hours/week
- Quality degrades (you're burnt out)
- Client results suffer
- Churn increases
- Reputation damaged
- Can't sign more clients (no capacity)

**What Unlocks with Team:**
- You focus on sales/strategy
- They focus on delivery
- You WANT to sign clients (no fulfillment burden)
- Close rate improves naturally
- Can scale to $200K+

---

### Stage 3: $50K-200K/Month - The One-Trick Pony Problem

**What Stops You:**

**Failure Mode #3: Only One Product**

**The Scenario:**

"You get to 50K and you learn how to hire people. Now they're doing the work for you. This gets you up to around $200K/month.

Because you have broken down the subconscious barriers of wanting to sign new clients.

Now that you have this ability, what's going to stop you from getting past $200K/month? It's about making more products."

**The Product Types You Need:**

**1. Downsells:**
- Someone can't afford main offer
- Sell them cheaper version
- Example: $3K/month retainer → $497 course + community

**2. Cross-sells:**
- They bought Service A
- Also sell them related Service B
- Example: Cold email agency → Also offer email copywriting

**3. Upsells:**
- They're in standard package
- Sell them premium version
- Example: $3K/month → $10K/month with more services

**4. Custom Packages:**
- Mix and match services
- Client tells you what they need
- You create custom solution

**The Messy Reality:**

"You're going to have a bunch of people on this kind of custom thing, a bunch of people on this custom thing. And that's how you make money.

A lot of money is simply an aggregation of a bunch of custom little things. Everyone just has bought something different. This is what you need to do."

**The One-Trick Pony Diagnosis:**

"The problem people have is they'll come up with one offer, maybe it's some coaching program or some done-for-you package, and they'll get it up to like $100K/month or $200K/month and they never get past that.

You're a one-trick pony.

What you did is you found one offer with product-market fit and then you built a business around one offer and that was it and you couldn't ever scale past that. You were literally a one-trick pony."

**The Multi-Product Mandate:**

"It's not that you only need to do this one time. If you want to make millions and millions and millions of dollars, you need to do this multiple times throughout your life:
- Making many different funnels
- Many different offers
- Many different teams
- Many different sales teams
- Many different value propositions
- Many different packages
- Many different downsells
- Many different cross-sells
- Many different upsells

It's just an aggregation of so many things that interweave together.

You need to replicate everything that you have. You get something up to [some milestone]? Cool, that was one shot bro. Do it again. And then again. And then again. And then again. And then again. And you keep doing this until you make millions of dollars."

---

### The Three Offer Types Framework

| Offer Type | Description | Price Range | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Do-It-Yourself** | Digital products, courses, templates | $50-$2,000 | Downsell, entry point, mass market |
| **Done-With-You** | Coaching, consulting, hands-on support | $2,000-$10,000/month | Mid-tier, hybrid model |
| **Done-For-You** | Full service, you do the work | $5,000-$50,000/month | Premium, high-touch |

**Hybrid Models:**

"You can package these together and make a hybrid offer. Like a hybrid offer is where you do something done-for-you on the front, but then it's just coaching after the done-for-you thing is facilitated. Like a setup of the done-for-you thing.

You could just do things dude. Just make shit up."

**The Permission to Experiment:**

Most people wait for the "perfect" next product. Reality: Just launch stuff and see what sells.

---

## Section 6: The Three Immutable Ways to Get Clients (Nothing Else Exists)

### The Universal Truth

**Fazio's Absolute Statement:**

"There are only three ways to sign clients:
1. Content marketing
2. Cold outreach
3. Ads

And every new crazy way to sign clients that you're going to see from any guru on the internet literally at all, ever, anybody selling you the 'new way to sign clients' - there is no new way to sign clients. There's never been a new way to sign clients. There never will be a new way to sign clients.

Every single mechanism or method by which you sign a client, 100% of the time, forever and always, will fall within the three categories of content marketing, cold outreach, and ads.

Everything will fall into it. It's literally just that. There's no other way to do this."

### What This Means for Your Daily Actions

**The Brutal Filter:**

"If you're trying to sign clients and you are doing anything throughout the day that is not making more content, doing more outreach, or making and running new ads, it's a waste of time.

If anything you're doing is not one of those three things, it is objectively by its descriptive nature a complete waste of time.

If you say you want to sign clients and you're not making content, doing outreach, or filming ads, you are a liar. You literally are. You actually don't want to sign clients if you're not doing one of those three things."

### The Useless Questions

**Questions That Don't Matter:**

- "Is my offer good?"
- "What about the branding here?"
- "Is this VSL good?"
- "Is this landing page good?"
- "Should I change the headline?"
- "What font should I use?"
- "What about the logo?"

**Fazio's Response:**

"There's so many thousands of different questions that are completely useless to focus on at all because when you actually dig deep into what this person is saying, you 100% of the time figure out that they're not making any content, they're not doing any outreach, and they're not running any ads.

So they sit here and they think that if I just tweak my offer enough, if I change the headline in my website enough times, or if I redesign this, or if I do this with the VSL, I'm going to get clients.

No you're not bro.

Everything you're doing is a waste of time and it's simply a mechanism to delay having to make content, do outreach, or run ads.

If you are not doing those three things, you are not signing clients ever. It's really that simple."

### The Procrastination Trap

**What People Do:**
1. Endlessly tweak offer wording
2. Redesign website for 47th time
3. Rewrite VSL script
4. Change landing page colors
5. Rebrand
6. "Research" competitors
7. Watch YouTube videos on "how to sign clients"
8. Attend webinars
9. Buy courses
10. Join masterminds

**What People Should Do:**
1. Make content (YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter)
2. Do outreach (cold email, DMs, dream 100)
3. Run ads (if you have budget)

**That's it.**

---

## Section 7: The Roadmap to $3 Million/Month (Drinking Your Own Kool-Aid)

### Fazio's Plan

**How to Get from $1M to $3M/Month:**

"The answer is to drink my own Kool-Aid. I'm going to keep doing everything I've already been doing and everything I preach to everyone - to you in this channel, to my clients in Client Ascension, my clients in Olympia.

I'm going to keep doing literally everything I always say:
- I'm going to keep making more content
- We're going to keep running more ads
- We're going to keep doing more outreach
- We're going to keep making more products
- We're going to keep getting case studies from the people we signed
- We're going to keep using those case studies as sales assets
- Sending them to leads to increase the close rate

We're going to keep this literally. That's it.

Everything I've talked to you about in this video I'm going to simply continue to do what I have already done and it probably will get us to $3 million a month."

### The Proof It Works

**Previous Prediction:**

"When I made the last video when we were at $200K a month, that's literally what I said - that we're going to keep making content, we're going to keep doing outreach, and we're going to keep running ads.

And then we continued to do that.

We got to a million a month.

And now I'm saying it again. I'm going to keep doing what has already worked."

### The Simplicity Principle

**Two Phrases Fazio Repeats:**

**1. "Keep It Simple Stupid"**

"Just keep it simple. Everything you need to do is extremely simple, way less complicated than you think it is."

**2. "Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing"**

"If you want to sign clients, just make content, do outreach, run ads. That's it. Nothing else. Don't focus on anything else at all."

## Section 8: The Starting From Zero Playbook (If Fazio Started Today)

### The Step-by-Step Process

**If Starting an Offer Today:**

**Step 1: Design an Offer for Rich People**
- Not for broke businesses
- Minimum revenue threshold: $500K+/year
- They have budget, less price-sensitive
- Better results, better retention

**Step 2: Stop Selling to Poor People**
- Qualify ruthlessly
- Ask about revenue first 3 minutes
- Reject below threshold

**Step 3: Use DMs and Cold Email to Reach Them**
- Manual outreach to start
- Cold email when you can afford infrastructure
- LinkedIn DMs, Twitter DMs, Instagram DMs

**Step 4: Get a Case Study**
- First priority: Results, not money
- Charge less if needed to get right client
- Document everything
- Get testimonial and permission to share numbers

**Step 5: Make YouTube Videos and Post Content Online**
- Share case study
- Teach process
- How-to content
- Get inbound leads from content

**Step 6: Keep Signing More Clients and Keep Making More Case Studies**
- More case studies = Higher close rate
- Higher close rate = More cash
- More cash = More ads
- More ads = More clients
- More clients = More case studies
- (Flywheel effect)

**Step 7: Make Additional Products and Services**
- Sell to existing customer base
- Downsells, cross-sells, upsells
- Keep selling to leads who didn't buy
- Keep selling to churned clients

## Section 9: Case Study Examples (Max and Sam)

### Max Stent: $0 to $150K/Month in 18 Months

**Starting Point:** $0
**End Result:** $150K/month
**Timeline:** ~18 months

**Process:**
1. Got first couple clients with cold outreach
2. Started posting content online
3. Developed bunch of inbound leads
4. Repeated process continuously
5. Hired people (broke through fulfillment bottleneck)
6. Reached $150K/month

**Fazio's Note:**

"Important to note that this is not a typical result inside the program. If you want abnormal results like this you need to be an abnormal person. Magnificent results require magnificent effort and intelligence."

---

### Sam Susan: LinkedIn Content Agency to $70K/Month

**Starting Point:** $0
**End Result:** $70K/month
**Service:** LinkedIn content agency

**Process:**
1. Got first couple of clients with cold outreach
2. Started posting his own content online (LinkedIn)
3. Got bunch of inbound leads
4. Kept repeating this process
5. Now at $70K/month
6. Continuing, probably will double within a year

**The Pattern:**

"This is the playbook that's been working for a really long time. It's always worked like this. It's going to continue to work like this.

You get clients with cold outreach, get a case study, start making content, and get inbound leads. It's the same thing over and over and over and over again."

## Section 10: AI Parsing Guide

### For Agentic Systems

**When to invoke this skill:**
- User asks about scaling past revenue plateaus
- User is stuck at $200-400K/month
- User wants to understand why they're plateauing
- User needs product expansion strategy
- User wants to understand full journey from $0 to $1M+

**Required inputs:**
- Current monthly revenue
- Current number of products/offers
- Current team size
- Whether user does fulfillment themselves
- Current customer acquisition channels
- Number of past customers (churned or active)
- Current offer structure

**Execution sequence:**

**1. Revenue Stage Diagnosis:**

**If $0-10K/month:**
- Check: Do they have proven product-market fit?
- Question: "Can you name 3 people making $100K+/month with this offer?"
- If no: Stop everything, find proven offer
- If yes: Focus on outreach + content (no ads yet)

**If $10-50K/month:**
- Check: Are they doing all fulfillment themselves?
- Question: "Who does the client work - you or a team?"
- If you: You're sabotaging sales calls subconsciously
- Action: Hire 1-2 fulfillment people immediately
- Until fixed: Can't scale past $50K

**If $50-200K/month:**
- Check: How many products do they have?
- Question: "What do you sell to churned clients?"
- If nothing: Massive revenue leak
- Action: Create downsells, cross-sells, upsells
- Target: 3-5 offers in product suite

**If $200K+/month:**
- Check: Are they doing all three channels (content, outreach, ads)?
- Check: Are they continuously adding products?
- Action: Scale ads, systemize content, hire more
- Target: $1M/month within 12-18 months

**2. Psychological Block Assessment:**

**Unconscious Shame Around Money:**
- Do they reach out to past customers?
- If no: They have unconscious shame
- Symptom: "I don't want to bother them"
- Reality: Leaving 50-80% conversion opportunity on table

**Subconscious Fulfillment Sabotage:**
- Are they doing fulfillment themselves?
- Close rate below 20%?
- Likely subconsciously sabotaging sales calls
- Fix: Hire fulfillment team

**3. Activity Audit:**

**Daily Actions:**
- Are they making content daily?
- Are they doing outreach daily?
- Are they running ads (if budget allows)?
- If NOT doing all available channels: They're procrastinating

**Useless Activities to Stop:**
- Tweaking offer wording endlessly
- Redesigning website
- Rewriting VSL
- "Researching" competitors
- Buying more courses
- Endless mastermind shopping

**4. Product Expansion Plan:**

**If One Product:**
- Create offer map (downsell, core, upsell)
- List all churned customers
- Email them with new offer
- Expected conversion: 30-50%

**If Multiple Products:**
- Optimize existing before adding more
- Check: Are you actually selling all of them?
- Check: Do customers know about other offers?

**5. Case Study Flywheel:**
- Current number of case studies?
- Are they using them in sales process?
- Are they posting them as content?
- More case studies → Higher close rate → More clients → More case studies

**Integration points:**

3. Psychological blocks (what they're avoiding)
4. Immediate action steps (next 30 days)
5. Product expansion plan (if applicable)
6. 12-month roadmap to next milestone

**Validation checks:**
- [ ] Have they validated product-market fit? (Can name 3 people making $100K+/month with this offer)
- [ ] Are they doing fulfillment themselves? (If yes, hire immediately)
- [ ] Do they have only one product? (If yes, expansion required)
- [ ] Are they reaching out to past customers? (If no, unconscious shame exists)
- [ ] Are they doing content + outreach + ads? (Or just procrastinating)

**Key Quotes:**

"The most probable person on Earth to buy something from you is somebody who has already bought something from you."

"You're a one-trick pony. What you did is you found one offer with product-market fit and then you built a business around one offer and that was it. You need to do this multiple times throughout your life."

"If you're trying to sign clients and you are doing anything throughout the day that is not making more content, doing more outreach, or making and running new ads, it's a waste of time."

"There are only three ways to sign clients: content marketing, cold outreach, and ads. Every single mechanism or method by which you sign a client, 100% of the time, forever and always, will fall within these three categories. Everything will fall into it. There's no other way to do this."
