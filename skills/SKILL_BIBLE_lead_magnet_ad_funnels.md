# SKILL BIBLE: Lead Magnet Ad Funnels (Why They Fail + How to Fix)

> Source: Matthew Larsen (1000x Leads)
> Context: Why most lead magnet ads fail and the complete system to make them work

---

## Executive Summary

Lead magnet ads are the BEST type of ad funnel - but ONLY if you have a complete funnel. Most people fail because they expect eCommerce-style instant conversion. The reality: lead magnet ads drive traffic into a nurturing system where multiple touchpoints convert leads over time.

---

## The Fundamental Misunderstanding

> "Just because a complete stranger didn't download a free document off an ad and instantly decide to book a call to give you 5K doesn't mean lead magnet ads don't work."

### The eCommerce Trap

**eCommerce ads:** Click → Buy or Don't
**Lead magnet ads:** Click → Download → Nurture → Multiple touchpoints → Eventually Book Call

> "Lead magnet ads do NOT work when you don't have a complete funnel. Most people who try this have a funnel that looks like [almost nothing]. How is a lead magnet ad supposed to work when there's nowhere for them to go?"

---

## The Complete Lead Magnet System

### The Real Customer Journey

```
See Paid Ad → Click → Submit Form → Get Lead Magnet
         ↓
Thank You Page (Learn About Offer)
         ↓
Email Flows (30+ emails)
         ↓
Newsletter (3-5x/week)
         ↓
Community + Retargeting Ads + Content
         ↓
Appointment Setter Reaches Out
         ↓
They Google You → Find YouTube, etc.
         ↓
Eventually Book Call
```

### All Touchpoints Working Together

After downloading lead magnet, they:
- Start receiving email nurturing
- Links with calendar
- Algorithm recommends your content more
- See your retargeting ads
- Google you (see what comes up)
- Sign up for webinar
- Join community
- Get contacted by appointment setter
- Receive newsletter multiple times per week
- Start watching YouTube videos

> "All of these things work together to make them book a call eventually."

### The Attribution Reality

> "You'll hear things like 'I just book calls and I don't even know where they're coming from anymore.' They're all coming from your top-of-funnel lead magnet ads. It's all volume driven through this process - you just don't even know how to attribute it anymore."

## The Four Variables to Optimize

| Variable | Goal | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| Ad Creative | Higher click-through rate | Lower cost per click |
| Landing Page | Higher opt-in rate | Lower cost per lead |
| Email Flows | Better nurturing | Higher booking rate |
| Rest of Funnel | More touchpoints | Higher conversion |

> "Improving ANY of them will improve the performance."

---

## Variable 1: Ad Creative

### The Goal

**Higher Click-Through Rate (CTR) = Lower Cost Per Click (CPC)**

### The Three Elements

**1. Scroll Stopper**
> "If they're scrolling through their feed in zombie mode, you need some sort of thumbnail or image that captures attention and makes them stop scrolling."

**Key:** Have a person in it (for this type of ad)

**2. Hook**
Once they stop, reel them in with the hook.

Example: "Struggling to grow your agency?"

**3. Benefit/Call to Action**
Get them to click.

Example: "This free system will help you build a $1M profit agency"

### Benchmark Results

```
CTR: 5.38% outbound click-through rate
CPC: $0.25 cost per click
CPL: $0.47 cost per result
Opt-in Rate: 53%
```

> "I've tested probably 5,000 different ads - combinations of these three things."

---

## Variable 2: Landing Page

### The Goal

**Higher Opt-in Rate = Lower Cost Per Lead**

### The Three Elements

**1. Headline**
> "A lot of the time a great headline for a lead magnet is just 'FREE [whatever the lead magnet is].' There was an old quote: Sometimes the best copy to sell a horse is 'horse for sale.'"

**2. Benefits**
Clear bullet points of what they get.

**3. Site Speed**
> "Site speed matters even more for lead magnet ads. They clicked on a free resource, probably not that interested. If it takes 3-10 seconds to load, they leave."

**Benchmark:** First Content Paint under 2 seconds (check PageSpeed Insights)

---

## Variable 3: Email Flows

### The Two Ways to Improve

**1. Handle Objections Better**
Brainstorm the 30 biggest objections/questions. Send one email per day until all addressed.

**2. Higher Click-Through Rate to Book Call**

### The Three Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Better subject line | More opens |
| Better first line | Hook them in |
| Better call to action | More clicks |

---

## Variable 4: Rest of Funnel

### The Checklist

| Element | Frequency/Status |
|---------|------------------|
| Free community | Exists and active |
| Newsletter | 3x per week minimum |
| YouTube content | 3x per week |
| Retargeting ads | All platforms |
| Appointment setter | Active outreach |

> "These are the things that convert lead magnet ads - not the ads themselves."

---

## The Target Metrics

### The Math That Works

```
Target CPC: $0.70 or less
Target Opt-in Rate: 70% or higher
Result: ~$1 cost per lead

Target Group/Webinar Conversion: 30%
Result: $3.33 per activation

Target Buyer Conversion: 0.5% (1 in 200)
Result: $666 CPA
```

**$666 CPA = acceptable for most agencies/B2B**

---

## Ad Testing Framework

### The Structure

```
1 Campaign
├── Ad Set 1 (Body Version A)
│   ├── Hook 1 + Body A
│   ├── Hook 2 + Body A
│   └── ... (10 hooks total)
└── Ad Set 2 (Body Version B)
    ├── Hook 1 + Body B
    ├── Hook 2 + Body B
    └── ... (10 hooks total)
```

**Result:** 20 ads total (10 per ad set)

### The Two Body Versions

**Version A:** What → Why → How → Proof
**Version B:** Proof → What → Why → How

### The 10 Hooks

| Hook Template | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| "Want to double your [desired outcome]? This is how you do it" | "Want to get twice as many clients for your agency? This is how" |
| "This is why your [product/problem] isn't working" | "This is why your cold emails aren't working" |
| "[Target audience], you won't believe this" | "Agency owners, you won't believe this" |
| "How I [achievement] within [timeframe]" | "How I grew my agency to $900K/month within 12 months" |
| "If you are a [target], listen up" | "If you are an agency owner, listen up" |
| "This is the #1 thing I tell every [target]" | "The #1 thing I tell every agency owner is this" |
| "If you want to [goal], you need to hear this" | "If you want to work with eCommerce brands, you need to hear this" |
| "When it comes to [topic], I only trust one single hack" | "When it comes to growing your agency, I only trust one hack" |
| "If you [do thing], you're going to enjoy this" | "If you run an agency, you're going to enjoy this video" |
| "Here's how you can [result] every single time" | "Here's how you can get more clients every single time" |

### First 3 Seconds Requirements

1. **Call out target audience**
2. **Visual hook** (not just verbal)
3. **Show your face**
4. **Convey the result**

### Measuring Results

**Comparing Bodies:** Compare full ad set results (same hooks, different bodies)
**Comparing Hooks:** Compare ads within same ad set (same body, different hooks)

> "This structure ensures we're continuously improving over time."
