## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Even great salespeople lose control of calls. The difference is knowing how to recover and get back on track.

**Signs You've Lost Control**:
- Prospect doing all the talking (irrelevant topics)
- You're answering questions before discovery
- 20+ minutes with no direction
- Feeling like you're chasing, not leading

---

## 2. RECOVERY TECHNIQUES

### The Pattern Interrupt

Stop the current flow and redirect:

```
"Hey, I want to make sure I'm not wasting your time. Can I ask you a quick question?"
```

Then redirect to discovery.

### The Summary Reset

```
"Let me make sure I'm tracking. You mentioned [X, Y, Z]. Did I get that right?"
```

Gets them to confirm, then you lead next question.

### The Time Check

```
"I want to be respectful of your time. We've got about 15 minutes left. Let me show you exactly how we'd help."
```

Transitions to pitch if discovery is done.

### The Honest Redirect

```
"I feel like I'm missing something. Can you help me understand what the real hesitation is?"
```

Gets to the real issue directly.

## 3. COMMON DERAILMENTS

### Prospect Takes Over

**Problem**: They're rambling about irrelevant topics.

**Recovery**:
```
"I appreciate you sharing that. Let me ask—how does [topic] relate to your main goal of [their stated goal]?"
```

If unrelated: "Got it. Let's park that for now and focus on [relevant topic]."

### Premature Questions

**Problem**: They're asking about price/process before discovery.

**Recovery**:
```
"Great question—I'll definitely cover that. First, I want to make sure I understand your situation so I can give you a relevant answer. Tell me about [discovery question]."
```

### Objections Before Pitch

**Problem**: Raising objections before you've pitched.

**Recovery**:
```
"I hear that concern. Let me address it properly in a few minutes when I walk you through how we work. For now, can you tell me more about [discovery question]?"
```

### Going Nowhere

**Problem**: Call feels aimless, no progress.

**Recovery**:
```
"Let me be direct—it seems like there might be something we're not addressing. What's really on your mind about this?"
```

## 4. PREVENTION

### Call Control Fundamentals

**Set Agenda Early**:
```
"Here's how I'd like to use our time: First, I'll ask some questions to understand your situation. Then, if it makes sense, I'll share how we might help. Sound good?"
```

**Ask Permission**:
```
"Mind if I ask a few questions first?"
```

**Transition Clearly**:
```
"Great, I've got a good picture. Let me share how we'd approach this."
```

### Stay Curious, Not Defensive

When they push back, get curious:
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What makes you feel that way?"
- "Help me understand"
