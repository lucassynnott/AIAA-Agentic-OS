## Category 1: Search Results Audit

### What to Check

Google the business name and see what appears.

### Results Hierarchy (Worst to Best)

1. **Nothing comes up** - Worst (anonymous scammer)
2. **Bad stuff comes up** - Better than nothing
3. **Everything excellent** - Goal

### What Should Appear

- [ ] Website (easy to find, not buried)
- [ ] YouTube videos (first page)
- [ ] LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Twitter profile
- [ ] Instagram profile
- [ ] Facebook page
- [ ] Review sites (Trustpilot, Clutch, G2)
- [ ] Free communities

### Common Issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Website hard to find | Better indexing, multiple pages |
| No YouTube on page 1 | Create 6-12 long-form videos (masterclasses, case studies) |
| No reviews | Sign up for all review sites, start collecting |

### Why This Matters

> "Many people who receive your outreach or see your ads won't click. They'll Google you instead."

---

## Category 2: Offers Audit

### The Five Questions

Anyone landing on your site should immediately know:

1. **What is the offer?** (from headline)
2. **Who is it for?** (from above the fold)
3. **What are the deliverables?** (plain English)
4. **What is the roadmap/timeline?**
5. **How do I get started?**

### Above the Fold Requirements

**Desktop:** What's visible without scrolling
**Mobile:** Even more critical (smaller viewport)

### Common Issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Too much jargon | Plain English |
| Not clear what they do | Put core offer in headline |
| Target audience unclear | Add callout above headline |
| No deliverables section | Add explicit list |
| No timeline | Add "how it works" with timeline |
| Weak CTA | Add "how to get started" section |

### The Stock Photo Problem

> "This really just feels like a foreign looking website. A lot more trust could be built if we do a better job with positioning."

**Fix:** Use images that resonate with target market
- Real estate agency → Photos of homes
- B2B targeting older professionals → Professional imagery

---

## Category 3: Positioning Audit

### The Core Question

Does everything speak to the type of client you're trying to attract?

### Common Positioning Mistakes

**Language mismatch:**
- Using beginner language when targeting established businesses
- Using casual language when targeting Fortune 500

**Visual mismatch:**
- 21-year-old bro in ads when targeting 45-year-old business owners
- Stock images instead of industry-relevant visuals

**Proof mismatch:**
- Small case studies when targeting large companies
- No industry-specific testimonials

### The Positioning Test

Ask: "Would my ideal client (describe them in detail) see this ad/page/profile and think 'This is for me'?"

**Example:**
> "I can't imagine a 45-year-old man who owns a brokerage doing $30 million in revenue, married with two kids, living in the suburbs, going to this ad and saying 'I need to hire this company.'"

### Fix

- [ ] All social media profiles have proper professional branding
