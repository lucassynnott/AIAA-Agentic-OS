# SKILL BIBLE: Low-Ticket to High-Ticket Funnels

## Executive Summary

Low-ticket to high-ticket (LTHT) funnels liquidate ad spend through front-end sales, then ascend buyers to premium offers. When done right, you're profitable before the high-ticket sale even happens. When done wrong, you bleed cash and attract broke buyers who never ascend. This skill bible covers pricing strategy, upsell architecture, consumption optimization, and setter deployment.

## The Core Math Problem

**Goal States (Best to Worst):**
1. **Ideal:** Profitable from low-ticket + upsells BEFORE high-ticket sale
2. **Good:** Break-even on front-end, high-ticket is pure profit
3. **Acceptable:** Liquidate 60%+ of ad spend, front cash for high-ticket
4. **Failure:** Liquidate small percentage, lose money indefinitely

> "A majority of you are probable to lose money and liquidate a small percentage of the total spend in that low ticket process."

## Pricing: The First Decision That Kills Most Funnels

### The Danger Zone: $7-$30

**The illusion:** "I'll get more buyers if it's cheap"

**The reality:**
- Yes, higher purchase rate
- But attracts people who can't afford upsells
- AOV stays too low to be profitable
- Cost per purchase rarely drops below $7-30

**The math that matters:**
> "If your AOV was only the first thing someone bought, could you get cost per purchases below that threshold?"

### Recommended Entry Pricing

| Price Range | Use Case | Risk Level |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| $7-$30 | **Danger zone** - avoid | High loss risk |
| $47-$97 | Standard recommendation | Balanced |
| $97-$197 | Premium positioning | Best qualified buyers |
| $200+ | Ultra-premium | Very qualified, lower volume |

**The Steakhouse Analogy:**
> "If I charge $70 for a filet, I can charge $19 for butter and $30-50 for sides. If my entry is a $7 hot dog, I have the wrong customer for those upsells."

---

## Upsell Architecture

### The Problem: Not Enough Upsells

> "Most people really whiff by not having enough upsells. Ideally you have 3-4 altogether."

### The Upsell Stack

```
Main Low-Ticket Product ($97+)
    ↓
Bump Sell (Checkbox on order form) - $17-29
    ↓
OTO 1 (First upsell page) - $100-300
    ↓
OTO 2 (Second upsell page) - $100-300
    ↓
OTO 3 (Optional third upsell) - $100-300
```

### Selecting What to Upsell

**The Branch Concept:**

Your high-ticket offer = "The Main Thing"
The main thing is made up of "smaller things"

```
High Ticket Offer (The Main Thing)
├── Component 1 (becomes low-ticket product)
│   ├── Sub-component A (becomes bump)
│   └── Sub-component B (becomes OTO1)
├── Component 2 (becomes OTO2)
├── Component 3 (becomes OTO3)
└── Component 4...
```

**Example: High Ticket Agency Program**
- Main Thing: Full agency training program
- Low-Ticket: Perfect Cold Video Pitch Bundle ($100)
- Bump: DM/Email swipe files ($19)
- OTO1: Conversation recordings library ($197)
- OTO2: Sales call recordings ($197)
- OTO3: Proposal templates + contracts ($147)

### The Complement Test

Use the Mastro's test: Does this upsell make sense given what they just bought?

| Scenario | Makes Sense? |
|----------|--------------|
| Steak → Butter/Sides | ✓ Yes |
| Steak → Wine | ✓ Yes |
| Steak → Car insurance | ✗ No |
| Video pitch training → Script swipes | ✓ Yes |
| Video pitch training → Random mindset course | ✗ No |

### Upsell Pricing Math

**Target take rates:** 5-20% of buyers

**The weighted average principle:**
> "Less people buying at $100-300 still gives higher AOV than 50% of people buying at $10."

If take rate too low:
1. Check if product complements the purchase
2. Lower price (easier fix)
3. Change what you're selling (harder fix)

---

## Consumption & Activation

### Why This Matters More Than Anything

> "Whatever it is that you actually sell has to be consumed and applied easily. They will not buy anything else until the value of the low ticket thing they bought is extracted successfully."

**The Book Funnel Problem:**
- Most people don't read books they buy
- Long consumption time = long ascension time
- Low activation rate = high objection rate

### The Fast Win Requirement

Low-ticket products must deliver:
1. **Quick consumption** (hours, not weeks)
2. **Easy application** (clear next steps)
3. **Fast result** (perceptible win)

> "An easy quick result has to happen. You cannot have a slow, long, monotonous, drawn out win."

### Solving Activation Problems

**Example: Perfect Cold Video Pitch**

Problem discovered: People bought but didn't send pitches (apprehension)

Solution: Added 3 mindset videos addressing:
- You MUST pitch businesses
- You need to pitch MORE than you think
- Optimize your profiles to look legitimate

**Result:** Success rate of people pitching increased dramatically

### For Book Funnels Specifically

Add to increase activation:
- Video series walking through each chapter
- Email sequence with executive summary per chapter
- "How to apply this chapter" section in each email
- Homework/implementation guides

---

## Setter Integration for Ascension

### Trigger-Based Outreach

Track consumption events in CRM:
- Did they open access email?
- Did they download the product?
- Did they consume the product?
- Did they receive physical product?
- Did they complete implementation?

### Setter as Accountability Coach

Don't immediately sell. Act as support:

1. **Day 1:** "Hey, saw you purchased [X]. Just checking - did you get access?"
2. **Day 3:** "Have you had a chance to go through [section]? Any questions?"
3. **Day 5:** "How's implementation going? I'm here if you need help."
4. **After result:** "Great to hear about [win]! When you're ready, let's talk about [high-ticket]."

### The Timing Rule

> "Your setter team ideally needs triggers. This is very simple to create with modern-day marketing automation and CRM."

Don't pitch high-ticket until:
- Product consumed
- Some implementation done
- Ideally, small win achieved

---

## The "Too Salesy" Objection

### The Mindset Problem

> "If you want to be Mr. High Horse - 'I don't want 3-4 upsells, that's too salesy' - congratulations, you're going to be unprofitable."

### The Solution

> "Sell people stuff that's actually valuable and you won't have that dumbass thought in the first place."

Every upsell should:
- Genuinely help them
- Complement what they bought
- Be worth the price
- Accelerate their results

If your upsells don't meet these criteria, you have a product problem, not a sales problem.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Entry price too low ($7-30)** → Broke buyers who never ascend
2. **Not enough upsells** → AOV too low to be profitable
3. **Upsells priced too low** → Even high take rate doesn't lift AOV
4. **Upsells don't complement** → Low take rates, confused buyers
5. **Slow consumption product** → Extended time to ascension
6. **No activation systems** → People don't use what they buy
7. **Setter pitches immediately** → Resistance before value extracted
8. **No triggers for outreach** → Random timing, missed opportunities

- [ ] Minimum 2 OTO pages (ideally 3-4)
- [ ] All upsells complement main purchase
- [ ] Each upsell branched from "main thing"

**Consumption:**
- [ ] Product consumable in hours, not weeks
- [ ] Clear implementation steps
- [ ] Fast win achievable
- [ ] Barriers to action addressed

**Systems:**
- [ ] CRM tracking consumption events
- [ ] Setter triggers configured
- [ ] Accountability outreach scripts ready
- [ ] Transition to high-ticket mapped

## AI Parsing Guide

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Building ascension funnels
- Improving front-end profitability
- Designing upsell architecture
- Reducing time to high-ticket conversion

**Key Entities:**
- AOV (Average Order Value) - must exceed CPA
- The "main thing" concept (high-ticket broken into components)
- Activation rate (percentage who use product)
- Consumption time (speed to value extraction)
- Setter triggers (automation for timed outreach)

**Decision Trees:**
- If losing money on front-end → check entry price and upsell stack
- If low upsell take rates → check complement fit and pricing
- If long ascension time → check consumption/activation
- If high objections on high-ticket → verify low-ticket value delivered
