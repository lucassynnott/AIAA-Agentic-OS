## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Show rate is the #1 neglected lever in most sales funnels. A 20-30% improvement in show rate compounds across your entire business—more revenue from the same ad spend.

**The Show Rate Truth**: Most people gaslight themselves into thinking they did everything they could when they've done 10% of what's possible.

**Show Rate Targets**:
| Funnel Type | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|-------------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Call Funnel | <50% | 50-60% | 60-70% | 70-80%+ |
| Webinar (Cold) | <10% | 10-15% | 15-20% | 20-25%+ |
| Webinar (Warm) | <20% | 20-30% | 30-40% | 40%+ |
| Challenge | <30% | 30-40% | 40-50% | 50%+ |

## 2. THE 5 BACKEND SELLING SYSTEMS

Jeremy Haynes' framework for maximizing show rates and sales process efficiency:

### System 1: Confirmation Page Best Practices
### System 2: Value-Dense Email Sequences
### System 3: Setter/Sales Rep Pre-Call Outreach
### System 4: The Hammer Them Campaign (Content Remarketing)
### System 5: [Inner Circle Exclusive - AI/Search Manipulation]

**Critical Insight**: You must do ALL of these, not just some. Partial execution = partial results = no results.

## 3. CONFIRMATION PAGE BEST PRACTICES

### Breakout Videos

4-19+ videos answering questions people have BEFORE the call/event.

**Sources for Topics**:
1. Sales team: "What questions annoy you that you keep answering?"
2. Webinar Q&A: What do people consistently ask?
3. Objections: What holds people back?
4. Expectations: What happens if the deal goes bad?

### The "Doomsday" Video (Highest Impact)

**Insight**: People want to know how bad a deal can go, not just how good.

**Example Structure**:
```
"Here's what happens if things don't work out.

[Show dispute rate from payment processor]
[Show refund process and examples]
[Show what you do when things go wrong]

We've had [X] refunds in [Y] sales. Here's why each happened and what we did about it."
```

**Why It Works**: Rich, sophisticated buyers know guarantees are often meaningless. They want to see PROOF of what happens when things go wrong.

### The Urgency Video (14% Lift in One Video)

**Case Study**: Real estate co-living offer

**The Setup**:
- Major cities rolled back housing restrictions
- News articles + .gov sources proving this
- First movers have the most opportunity

**The Frame**:
```
"Who has more opportunity—the person who acts right after 
restrictions are repealed, or the person who waits years 
until everyone else is already doing it?

The answer is obvious."
```

**Result**: Single video = 14% lift in show rate

### Testing Confirmation Page Videos

**Metrics to Track**:
- Play rate (% who hit play)
- Engagement rate (% who watch through)
- Show rate lift per video

**Diagnosis**:
- High play rate + good engagement + no show rate lift = **Wrong messaging**
- Low play rate = **Bad thumbnail/positioning**
- Low engagement = **Content not compelling**

## 4. VALUE-DENSE EMAIL SEQUENCES

### Frequency Best Practices

**Maximum**: Up to 6 emails per day (yes, really)

**Why It Works**: When people WANT information, they consume it. Open rates of 50-70% on high-frequency sequences.

**How to Find Your Limit**:
1. Start with 3-4 emails/day
2. Add one more
3. Watch open rates
4. If open rate drops = went too far
5. Pull back to previous level

### Open Rate Benchmarks

| Frequency | Expected Open Rate |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Traditional | 30-50% |
| Value-dense | 50-70% |

**Floor/Ceiling Concept**: Your emails will have a 20% range. First email might be 70%, last might be 50%. That's normal. Only pull back when you break the FLOOR by a significant amount.

### Timing by Funnel Type

**Call Funnel (48-72 hour window)**:
- Blast 6/day immediately upon booking
- Every 2 hours from 9am-9pm

**Webinar (2-week promotion)**:
```
Days 14-10: 1-2 emails total (light touch)
Days 9-5: Gradual increase
Days 4-1: 4-6 emails/day (heavy)
Day of: Maximum frequency
```

**Key Insight**: Stack emails toward the END of the promotion cycle, not evenly distributed.

### Email Content Philosophy

**Wrong Approach**:
```
Subject: Reminder about your call tomorrow!
Hey, just reminding you about your call. See you there!
```

**Right Approach**:
```
Subject: The #1 question people ask before our call

[Name],

Tomorrow we talk at [time].

The #1 question people have before we meet: [Question]

Here's the short answer: [Valuable answer]

The longer answer involves [tease more depth]...

We'll cover this in detail on the call.

Talk soon,
[Name]

P.S. If you want to dive deeper before we talk, here's a 4-minute video on this: [link]
```

### Why Value-Dense > Link-Based

- Click-through rates are only 2-5%
- 95-98% of people never click your links
- Treat the EMAIL as the consumable
- Put the value IN the email, links are bonus

### What to Write About

**Source the Content**:
1. Sales team questions
2. Reasons people DON'T buy
3. Reasons people DO buy
4. What accelerates buying decisions
5. Price/funding questions
6. Objections that prevent one-call closes

**AI Workflow**:
```
1. Record breakout video answering question
2. Transcribe video
3. Feed to AI with existing email samples
4. Generate value-dense email version
5. Include link to video at bottom
```

## 5. SETTER/SALES REP PRE-CALL OUTREACH

### The Four Seasons Principle

**Bad Approach** (Selfish):
```
"Hey, just wanted to make sure you're going to show up."
```

**Good Approach** (Four Seasons):
```
"Hey [Name], this is [Rep] from [Company].

Saw you're scheduled for tomorrow at [time]. 

Wanted to reach out personally—did you get the calendar invite with the link?
That's the #1 thing people ask when they can't find how to join.

Also, I took a moment to look you up and saw you [specific detail about them].
We've had a few people like you come through—I'm going to send you some 
info on their outcomes so you can see what their process was.

Anything I can answer for you before we talk?"
```

### The Selfie Video

**Highest Impact Tactic**: Sales rep sends selfie video via text (iPhone, not automation).

**Script**:
```
"Hey [Name], it's [Rep] here. Just wanted to put a face to the name 
before we chat tomorrow.

Really looking forward to learning more about your situation with [their challenge].

If any questions come up between now and then, just text me back.

Talk soon!"
```

### Why This Works

1. Establishes real human connection
2. Highest delivery rate (text > email)
3. Differentiates from every other company
4. Creates social pressure to show up
5. Opens communication channel for questions

## 6. THE HAMMER THEM CAMPAIGN

### Content Requirements

| Type | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Short-form | 30-50 pieces | Quick answers, objection handling |
| Long-form | 15-30 pieces | Deep dives, trust building |

### Frequency Goal

**Target**: 15-20 impressions between booking and event

**Platforms**: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn—anywhere you can pay to show content.

### Content Topics (Four Quadrants)

1. **Questions**: What do they need to know?
2. **Objections**: What's holding them back?
3. **Expectations**: What happens after purchase?
4. **Social Proof**: Who else has succeeded?

### The Halfassing Problem

**Common Mistake**: "I tried Hammer Them with 23 short-form videos and it didn't work."

**Reality**: You need:
- ALL 30-50 short-form pieces
- ALL 15-30 long-form pieces
- Hitting 15-20 frequency
- With the RIGHT content topics

Partial execution = no results.

## 7. THE GASLIGHT TRAP

### Common Self-Deception

"I did everything I could and show rate barely improved."

**Reality Check**: Did you actually do:
- [ ] 4-19+ breakout videos on confirmation page?
- [ ] A doomsday/transparency video?
- [ ] An urgency video with real proof?
- [ ] 3-6 value-dense emails per day?
- [ ] Sales rep selfie video outreach?
- [ ] 30-50 short-form content pieces?
- [ ] 15-30 long-form content pieces?
- [ ] 15-20 frequency in Hammer Them?

If any are missing, you haven't tried everything.

### The One Thing vs. The Stack

Sometimes ONE action improves show rate 30%. Usually it's a combination of several things, each adding 5-10%.

**Key Principle**: Take actions UNTIL you get the result. Don't stop after trying one thing.

---

## 8. SHOW RATE MATH

### Call Funnel Example

```
100 calls booked
× 60% show rate = 60 shows
× 30% close rate = 18 sales
× $5,000 ACV = $90,000

vs.

100 calls booked
× 80% show rate = 80 shows
× 30% close rate = 24 sales
× $5,000 ACV = $120,000

Difference: $30,000 from same ad spend
```

### Webinar Example

```
1,000 registrants (@ $20 CPL = $20,000 spend)
× 10% show rate = 100 live attendees
× 70% stay for pitch = 70 during pitch
× 20% book call = 14 calls
× 50% show = 7 sales calls
× 30% close = 2 sales

vs.

1,000 registrants
× 20% show rate = 200 live attendees
× 70% stay for pitch = 140 during pitch
× 20% book call = 28 calls
× 50% show = 14 sales calls
× 30% close = 4 sales

Double the sales from same spend.
```
