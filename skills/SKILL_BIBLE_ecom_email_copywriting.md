## PART 1: CORE FRAMEWORK

### The Sturtevant Email Philosophy

**The 40% Rule**: Email should generate 40-60% of total brand revenue when executed properly. This isn't aspirational - it's the baseline for properly optimized email programs.

**The Intimacy Principle**: Email is the most intimate marketing channel. Unlike social media or ads, email lands directly in someone's personal inbox. This requires a fundamentally different approach that respects this intimacy while leveraging it for conversions.

**The Anti-Corporate Mandate**: Modern consumers are trained to ignore corporate-looking emails. The brands winning in email look and feel like messages from friends, not faceless corporations.

### The Three Pillars of High-Converting Email

#### Pillar 1: Psychological Triggers
Every email must activate specific psychological mechanisms:

**Novelty Trigger**: Humans are wired to pay attention to new things. Use phrases like "you've never seen this before," "this isn't your average," or "introducing something completely different."

**Social Proof Integration**: Not just testimonials, but proof that real people are using and loving the product. Include specific numbers: "over 500 customers," "26 verified patents," "40+ five-star reviews."

**Scarcity and Urgency**: Create genuine time pressure. "Last chance," "final hours," "while supplies last" - but only when authentic.

**Us vs. Them Positioning**: Position your brand against "big chocolate," "corporate giants," or "gas station candy." This creates tribal loyalty and justifies premium pricing.

#### Pillar 2: Strategic Simplicity
**The 250-Word Rule**: Most high-converting emails stay under 250 words. Longer emails get skimmed, shorter emails get read completely.

**Single Goal Focus**: Each email should have ONE primary objective. Don't overwhelm with multiple calls-to-action or competing messages.

**Visual Hierarchy**: Guide the eye through a logical flow - headline, benefit, social proof, call-to-action, footer.

#### Pillar 3: Authentic Personalization
**Founder Voice**: Emails should sound like they're coming from a real person, preferably the founder. Use names like "Brian from Create" or "Corbin from Breeze."

**Conversational Tone**: Write like you're texting a friend. Use contractions, casual language, and personal anecdotes.

**Real Problem Solving**: Address genuine customer concerns and objections, not just product features.

### The Revenue-Generating Email Types

#### 1. Product Highlight Emails (30% of sends)
Focus on a single product or collection with educational content about why it's superior.

**Structure**:
- Personal greeting from founder
- Problem identification
- Product as solution
- Social proof
- Single clear CTA

#### 2. Educational/Value Emails (25% of sends)
Provide genuine value without immediate sales pressure. These build trust and engagement.

**Examples**:
- "Why we choose these ingredients"
- "The truth about [industry myth]"
- "How to get the most from your purchase"

#### 3. Social Proof Emails (20% of sends)
Showcase customer success stories, reviews, and user-generated content.

**Key Elements**:
- Real customer names and photos
- Specific results or benefits
- Authentic testimonials (not overly polished)

#### 4. Sale/Promotional Emails (15% of sends)
Direct promotional content with clear value propositions.

**Critical Components**:
- Clear discount amount (40% off, not "up to 40%")
- Limited time frame
- Reason for the sale
- Easy redemption process

#### 5. Plain-Text Founder Emails (10% of sends)
The secret weapon that often generates the highest engagement and revenue per send.

### The Plain-Text Email Revolution

**Why Plain-Text Outperforms Graphics**:
- Appears in inbox like personal message
- Higher deliverability rates
- Increased open rates (often 50%+ higher)
- Better mobile experience
- Builds authentic relationship

**Plain-Text Email Structure**:
```
Subject: Quick question about [product/concern]

Hey [Name],

[Personal opener - 1 sentence]

[Problem/question - 2-3 sentences]

[Solution/answer - 2-3 sentences]

[Social proof - 1 sentence]

[Clear CTA - 1 sentence]

[Personal sign-off]
[Founder name]

P.S. [Urgency or bonus value]
```

### The Psychology of Email Timing

**Optimal Send Times**:
- 6:00-7:00 PM: When people are winding down, checking personal email
- 10:00-11:00 AM: Mid-morning break, second email check
- 1:00-2:00 PM: Lunch break email checking

**Frequency Strategy**:
- Welcome series: Daily for first 5 days
- Regular campaigns: 2-3 times per week
- Plain-text emails: 1-2 times per month maximum
- Sale periods: Daily during promotion

### The Conversion Funnel Integration

Email doesn't exist in isolation. It must integrate with the entire customer journey:

**Awareness Stage**: Educational content, brand story, problem identification
**Consideration Stage**: Product comparisons, social proof, objection handling
**Decision Stage**: Clear offers, urgency, risk reversal
**Retention Stage**: Onboarding, upsells, loyalty building

## PART 2: STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### Phase 1: Campaign Ideation and Strategy

#### Step 1: Audience Analysis (30 minutes)
Before writing a single word, understand exactly who you're talking to:

1. **Demographics**: Age, gender, income, location
2. **Psychographics**: Values, interests, pain points
3. **Buying Behavior**: How they shop, what influences decisions
4. **Email Behavior**: When they check email, device preferences

**Tool**: Create customer personas with specific names and detailed backgrounds.

#### Step 2: Campaign Goal Setting (15 minutes)
Define exactly what success looks like:

- **Primary Goal**: Revenue target, click-through rate, conversion rate
- **Secondary Goals**: List growth, engagement, brand awareness
- **Success Metrics**: Specific numbers to track

**Example Goals**:
- Generate $50,000 in revenue from single campaign
- Achieve 25%+ click-through rate
- Convert 8%+ of recipients to purchase

#### Step 3: AI-Powered Ideation (45 minutes)
Use ChatGPT or similar tools to generate campaign concepts:

**Prompt Template**:
```
"I need email campaign ideas for [brand type] selling [products] to [target audience]. 

Brand voice: [casual/professional/edgy]
Recent launches: [product details]
Current season/timing: [context]
Brand values: [sustainability/quality/innovation]

Give me 10 campaign ideas with subject lines and brief descriptions."
```

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Aligns with brand voice
- Addresses customer pain points
- Creates genuine urgency or interest
- Differentiates from competitors

#### Step 4: Content Calendar Integration (20 minutes)
Map campaigns to broader marketing calendar:

- **Product Launches**: 2-week email sequence
- **Seasonal Promotions**: 5-7 email series
- **Educational Content**: Weekly value-driven emails
- **Retention Campaigns**: Monthly check-ins

### Phase 2: Copywriting Process

#### Step 5: Headline Creation (30 minutes)
The headline determines if your email gets read. Test multiple options:

**Headline Formulas**:
- **Curiosity**: "The ingredient we'll never use"
- **Benefit**: "Finally, chocolate that doesn't ruin your diet"
- **Social Proof**: "Why 10,000+ customers choose us over [competitor]"
- **Urgency**: "Last 24 hours for 40% off everything"
- **Personal**: "A quick note from our founder"

**Testing Process**:
1. Write 10 different headlines
2. Test with small segment (10% of list)
3. Send winning headline to remaining 90%

#### Step 6: Opening Hook Development (20 minutes)
First sentence must grab attention and create engagement:

**Hook Types**:
- **Question**: "Ever wonder why gas station candy tastes so artificial?"
- **Controversial Statement**: "Most protein powders are basically expensive chalk"
- **Personal Story**: "I used to hate the gym until I discovered..."
- **Shocking Statistic**: "97% of skincare products contain this harmful ingredient"

#### Step 7: Body Copy Structure (45 minutes)
Follow the proven AIDA framework with Sturtevant modifications:

**A - Attention**: Hook + problem identification
**I - Interest**: Why this matters to them specifically
**D - Desire**: Paint picture of life with solution
**A - Action**: Single, clear call-to-action

**Body Copy Template**:
```
[Hook - 1 sentence]

[Problem elaboration - 2-3 sentences]

[Solution introduction - 1-2 sentences]

[Social proof - 1-2 sentences]

[Benefit reinforcement - 2-3 sentences]

[Call to action - 1 sentence]
```

#### Step 8: Call-to-Action Optimization (15 minutes)
The CTA can make or break conversion rates:

**High-Converting CTA Examples**:
- "Shop [Specific Product] Now"
- "Claim Your 40% Discount"
- "Get Yours Before We Sell Out"
- "Join 10,000+ Happy Customers"

**CTA Placement Rules**:
- Always above the fold
- Repeat 2-3 times in longer emails
- Use action-oriented language
- Create visual emphasis (buttons, underlining)

#### Step 9: Subject Line Creation (25 minutes)
Subject lines determine open rates. Test extensively:

**High-Performing Subject Line Categories**:

**Curiosity-Based**:
- "The ingredient everyone's talking about"
- "Why we'll never use palm oil"
- "This isn't your average protein powder"

**Benefit-Driven**:
- "Finally, jeans that actually fit"
- "The chocolate that won't ruin your diet"
- "Skincare that works in 7 days"

**Personal/Founder**:
- "A quick note from Brian"
- "Why I started this company"
- "My biggest mistake (and how you can avoid it)"

**Urgency/Scarcity**:
- "24 hours left: 40% off everything"
- "Only 50 left in stock"
- "Last chance for free shipping"

**Question-Based**:
- "Is creatine just for men?"
- "What's really in your chocolate?"

## PART 3: EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Product Launch Email

**Subject**: "You've never seen chocolate like this"

```
Hey [First Name],

I'm probably biased, but I think we just created the best chocolate bar on the planet.

You've had chocolate. You've had peanut butter. But never like this.

This isn't your average gas station candy. We're talking about rich, creamy peanut butter meets organic milk chocolate in a combo that hits different.

Over 500 customers tried our beta version. The feedback? "This bar will ruin all other chocolate for you."

Warning: addictively good. Your taste buds will thank you.

[SHOP PEANUT BUTTER BAR]

Clean ingredients. No palm oil. No artificial anything. Just pure, real-deal deliciousness.

Cheers,
[Founder Name]

P.S. We're taking on Big Chocolate with this one. Support the little guys who actually care about what goes in your food.

### Template 2: Educational Value Email

**Subject**: "The truth about creatine (it's not just for men)"

```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: Is creatine just for guys?

Totally fair question, but it's a myth that's holding a lot of women back from seeing real performance gains.

Here's the truth: Women actually have lower natural creatine stores than men. So supplementing it can be even more beneficial.

It won't make you bulky. It won't cause water retention. It WILL help with:
• Energy during workouts
• Muscle recovery  
• Overall strength
• Brain function

We use 100% soluble creatine monohydrate. That means it dissolves fully, digests clean, and doesn't leave you feeling bloated like the old school powders.

[TRY CREATINE FOR WOMEN]

12 dental research studies back this up. Plus, we have 40+ patents and 26 verified experts on staff.

Hope that helps!

Too many brands promise the world and deliver disappointment. We wanted to create products that actually deliver results you can see and feel.

Diana's not alone. We've got 100+ verified reviews saying the same thing.
