# SKILL BIBLE: Seven Offers to Scale to $10M/Year

> Source: Matthew Larsen (1000x Leads)
> Context: Complete offer architecture for scaling agencies - 7 offer types that capture 100% of target market

---

## Executive Summary

Most agencies have one offer (recurring service) and miss 99% of their market. The seven-offer system captures every segment of your target market, 2-3x revenue while 5-10x profit because low-fulfillment offers are nearly pure margin.

---

## The Problem with Single-Offer Agencies

**The 1% Problem:**
Only 1% of your target market is qualified for your main recurring service at any given time.

**"Qualified" means:**
- Right pricing
- Actively looking
- You want to work with them
- Same industry/niche
- They see the need

**The result:** 99% of leads go nowhere.

> "You need to build up a funnel that generates highly qualified leads who in theory would be ready to go as you build up your operations."

---

## The Seven Offers

### 1. Recurring Service (The Backbone)

**What it is:** High-priced main service that builds MRR

**Why it matters:**
- Stability to reinvest in ads
- Confidence to reinvest in infrastructure
- Foundation for scaling

**The Ideal Setup:**
- < 10% monthly churn
- Gross LTV of $30,000+
- $250/hour effective delivery rate

**The Math:**
```
CAC: $1,000
LTV: $30,000+
Ratio: 30:1 = Hyperscale territory

LTV: $100,000+ = "Print money and exit"
```

> "If you can't get churn under 10% eventually, there's either some market fit issue or your skill set would be better doing something else."

---

### 2. Intro Offer (Foot in the Door)

**What it is:** Low-priced one-time offer acting as a paid trial

**Purpose:** Reduce risk, get foot in door, upsell to recurring later

**Example (Larsen's CRO Agency):**
- Main service: $8-15K/month CRO retainer
- Intro offer: $2,500 one-time landing page
- Result: 55% success rate (better than what they had)
- Upsell: "Let me do that for your full site"

**The Ideal Setup:**
- Deliver at $250/hour+
- Price as LOW as possible (defeats purpose if $8K)
- CAC < Total gross margin

**The Math:**
```
Price: ~$2,500
Fulfillment: 10 hours or less
Hourly rate: $250+
CAC covered by intro offer
Upsell LTV:CAC ratio = essentially infinite
```

> "Once you do a good job on the intro offer, it becomes a lot easier to sell them the recurring service."

---

### 3. Referral Partnerships (Capture the Edges)

**What it is:** Referrals for those too small OR too large

**Two Types:**

**Too Small:**
- Refer to agencies in Eastern Europe/South America
- Lower cost providers

**Too Large:**
- Refer to larger agencies if you're not confident
- Protects against risk

**Adjacent Services:**
- Facebook ads
- Google ads
- TikTok
- Email marketing
- SEO

**The Ideal Setup:**
- 3 larger agencies (same service)
- 3 smaller agencies (same service)
- Multiple adjacent service partners

**Scale Impact:**
```
100 leads/month
20 referred away
$1,000/month each referral fee
$20,000/month recurring (stacks)
```

> "Vet these people and really trust them. If they do a horrible job for your client, that's going to reflect negatively on you."

---

### 4. Course (DIY Education)

**What it is:** Educational offer for those who can't afford service or want to DIY

**Who buys:**
- Can't afford your service
- Want to learn themselves
- Don't want to hire

**The Ideal Setup:**
- Repackage your internal employee training
- Already building this anyway
- Kill two birds with one stone

> "Courses get a bad name, but there's a lot of people who just want to learn to do it themselves."

---

### 5. Program (Done-With-You)

**What it is:** Course + one-on-one or group help

**Who Actually Buys (Surprising):**

> "I launched a program thinking I was going to get more done-with-you types, but it was actually dominated by 8-9 figure brands with in-house teams who wanted an outside expert to review what their team is doing."

**The Ideal Setup:**
- Deliver at $1,000/hour+ of YOUR time
- You're the face, they expect you
- Example: $6K/3 months = 6 hours max of your time
- Team handles the rest

---

### 6. Digital Product (Automated Assets)

**What it is:** Productized offer under $100 (impulse buy)

**Format:** Templates or assets (NOT information - that's a course)

**Critical Distinction:**
> "I see people say '$99 to make them some ads.' That is an intro offer, that is a service. You can't play any part in digital products - it has to be automated or it's not a product."

**Example (Larsen's $1M+ Product):**
- 100 Webflow landing page templates
- Sold for $97
- 14,500 units sold
- Led naturally to landing page services

**The Ideal Setup:**
- Templates that make money or save time
- Under $100 (impulse threshold)
- 100% automated delivery
- Naturally leads to main service

---

### 7. Affiliate Commissions (Software Recommendations)

**What it is:** Referral fees from tools they need

**When they come in:**
- During onboarding
- Inside community
- Through content/recommendations

**The Rule of Four:**
> "If you do more than 4 tools, the effectiveness goes down. If you say 'get these 4 tools,' they'll sign up. If you say 'get these 50 tools,' they'll sign up for none."

**The Ideal Setup:**
- 4 most important tools
- Put in onboarding sequence
- Include in community resources

## The $250/Hour Minimum Rule

> "I always want to deliver every service at $250/hour or more as an effective hourly rate."

**Why $250/hour minimum:**

When you account for:
- Customer acquisition costs
- Closing costs
- Ad costs
- Content team
- Outreach team
- Software costs
- Labor to fulfill
- Non-revenue roles (finance, HR)
- Taxes

**If you're under $250/hour, there's nothing left to scale.**

---

## Revenue Impact

**Before (Single Offer):**
```
Revenue: X
Profit: 10-40% margin
Leads captured: 1%
```

**After (Seven Offers):**
```
Revenue: 2-3x
Profit: 5-10x (high-margin offers)
Leads captured: ~100%
Stability: Diversified (not all eggs in one basket)
Valuation: Higher (more stable revenue)
```
