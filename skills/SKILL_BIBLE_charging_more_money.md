# SKILL BIBLE: How to Charge More Money and Still Sign Clients (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the three mechanisms for raising prices without losing clients—plus how to transform one-time services into recurring revenue. The three levers: Perceived Authority, Transfer of Logistical Intensity, and Specific Function. The key insight: price resistance comes from lack of trust, lack of value, or wrong client type. Fix these, charge more.

**Key Quote:** "People only feel safe with somebody they look up to. Spending a lot of money is a scary thing. If you want clients to feel safe doing a scary thing, they have to look up to you as if you will take care of them."

> This skill bible explains when to RAISE prices. The companion document explains when to LOWER prices.
> **Decision Framework:**
> - **Raise prices when:** Close rate >30% consistently, you have perceived authority, you can transfer logistical intensity
> - **Lower prices when:** Close rate <20%, sales feel like constant uphill battle, clients NOT telling you to charge more
> Both strategies can be correct—the key is DIAGNOSING which situation applies to you.

## Section 1: The Two Problems

### Problem 1: Price Resistance

Every time you try to raise prices:
- Existing clients churn
- Can't sign new clients
- Revenue drops

### Problem 2: One-Time vs. Recurring

Most deals are one-time:
- No predictable revenue
- Always hunting new clients
- No compounding growth

---

## Section 2: Mechanism 1 - Perceived Authority

### Why Authority Matters

Spending money is scary. Everyone on the planet feels this.

**To feel safe doing scary things:**
- They need to look up to you
- They need to trust you
- They need to believe you'll take care of them

### How Authority Is Derived

**Method 1: Content**

Have you proven you know what you're talking about?

**Required platforms:**
- YouTube
- LinkedIn
- Twitter/X

**This is NOT optional anymore.** The market has evolved. You must have content online.

**Method 2: Recommendations**

Were you recommended by somebody else?

**Problem:** If you don't have clients, no one can recommend you.

**Solution:** Lean harder on content until you have clients to refer you.

### The Social Proof Equation

**Social proof = What other humans do**

This is the largest indicator of what is "correct" to do.

**To make clients feel safe:**
- Show other humans rely on you
- Position yourself as authority figure
- Become "an oracle of sorts... perhaps a wizard"

## Section 3: Mechanism 2 - Transfer of Logistical Intensity

### The Core Principle

**Simply do more stuff that other people don't do.**

### Example 1: Roofing Marketing

**Situation 1:**
- You're a roofing marketing company
- You do NOT qualify leads for client
- Result: Same as every other roofing marketing company
- Differentiation: ZERO

**Situation 2:**
- You're a roofing marketing company
- You DO qualify leads for client
- Get a human to call and confirm:
  - Do they actually want a roof quote?
  - Are they financially qualified?
- Result: Basically nobody else does this
- Differentiation: AUTOMATIC

### Why This Works

**Qualifying leads requires:**
- Manual labor (doing it yourself), OR
- Hiring/paying someone else

Both are a pain in the ass.

**Nobody wants to do it:**
- You don't want to
- Client doesn't want to
- Competitors don't want to

**Therefore:** Supply is LOW → You can charge MORE.

### Example 2: Sales Funnel Agency

**Agency Owner #1:**
- Funnel build and design
- Automation setup
- Copywriting

**Agency Owner #2:**
- Funnel build and design
- Automation setup
- Copywriting
- **PLUS:**
- Ad scripting and editing
- VSL copywriting and editing
- Email flows
- Media buying
- CRO and weekly split tests

**Who charges more?** Obviously Agency Owner #2.

### The Double Amplification Effect

Agency Owner #2 doesn't just elevate himself—he also highlights that competitors DON'T do:
- This
- This
- This
- This
- This

**Result:** Puts you UP and competitors DOWN simultaneously.

## Section 4: Mechanism 3 - Specific Function

### The Question

**Who will pay more for scripted and edited videos?**

| Client Type | Specific Function | Willingness to Pay |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Podcast guy wanting clips | More views | Lower |
| DTC ecom brand wanting product ads | Push paid traffic | MUCH Higher |

### Why It Matters

The DTC brand pushing six figures/month in ad spend can afford substantially higher prices than random podcast guy.

### The Career Advice Version

**Who you sell to = Your network = Your career**

Makes sense to build this based on:
- Industries where money is flowing
- Become hyper useful to those people
- Become "that guy" specifically for people with money

## Section 5: Turning One-Time Into Recurring

### The Core Principle

Monthly recurring services require monthly recurring work.

**Something new must be occurring all the time.**

### Why Content Agencies Churn

It's usually NOT that your work isn't good.

**Real reasons:**
- Client stops doing content marketing
- Too busy
- Too lazy

### Two Solutions

**Solution 1:** Script the videos for them
- Transfers more logistical intensity
- Makes their life easier
- Increases value and prices

**Solution 2:** Work with higher quality business owners
- Make more money
- Take business more seriously
- Requires increasing perceived authority

### Example: Web Design Agency

**Original Offer:**
"I'll build you a conversion-optimized landing page"

**Transformed Recurring Offer:**
"I'll build you a conversion-optimized funnel or landing page EVERY MONTH with:
- New lead magnet I design
- Weekly split tests on all funnels
- Static ad creatives for traffic
- Backend email automations for leads"

**Result:** Valuable recurring service with high logistical intensity = Can charge substantially more.

## Section 6: The Formula

### To Turn One-Time Into Recurring

1. **Add more stuff** (Transfer logistical intensity)
2. **Work with better clients** (Increase perceived authority to attract them)
3. **Offer services that directly contribute to revenue/profit** (Specific function)
