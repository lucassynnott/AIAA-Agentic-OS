# SKILL BIBLE: The Path to $100K/Month in 24 Months (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the complete step-by-step path from zero to $100K/month in 24 months. Based on Daniel Fazio's experience (2.5 years from zero to first $100K month) and 1,000+ B2B clients. The core sequence: Skill Acquisition → Free/Performance Work → Offer Creation → High-Volume Outreach → Asset Production → Hiring/Systems → Funnels/Paid Ads.

**Key Quote:** "You're not hitting $100K/month in 12 months as a beginner. It took me 2.5 years from complete zero, and even that is abnormal. You need to go through the 2-year despair phase before you have any clue what's going on."

## Section 1: The Broad Overview

### What You're Building

**Sell a service, not a product:**
- Products require money to create
- Services require time
- You have more time than money

**B2B (Business to Business):**
- Sell to businesses, not consumers
- Get paid based on results, not hours
- Income tied to skill, not time

### The Three Questions

1. What skills do I learn?
2. How do I get clients?
3. How do I scale?

## Section 3: Minimal Viable Competence

### How to Get Good Enough to Sell

**The Formula:**
1. Watch 100 hours of YouTube content
2. Buy 10 books and read to completion
3. Buy a couple courses and FINISH them
4. Actually do the work

**The Balance:**

```
[Do Nothing Until Expert] ←——→ [Sell Knowing Nothing]
                    ↓
              Be HERE
         (Minimally Viable)
```

**Goal:** Know how to execute. Don't need to be an expert.

---

## Section 4: Free/Performance Work (Step 2)

### Why This Step Is Required

**When you're a beginner:**
- Nobody pays $3K-$5K for no reason
- They need to believe in ROI
- You are a risk/liability
- They think: "More probable I lose money than make money"

### The Compensation Strategy

**To compensate for beginner risk:**
- Work for free, OR
- Work 100% performance basis
- Client takes ZERO financial risk

### The Hormozi Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**When Effort & Sacrifice (price) = $0:**
- Value shoots up dramatically
- More people sign
- Compensates for no case studies

### The Timeline

Do free/performance work until:
- 2-3 case studies
- Results proportional to desired price by 10x

**Example:** Want to charge $5K/month? Need case study showing $50K/month value created.

---

## Section 5: Offer Creation (Step 3)

### The Fundamental Truth

"Nobody buys email marketing. They buy the RESULT that email marketing produces."

**Wrong framing:** "I will do your email marketing for $3K/month"
**Right framing:** "I can make you $30K/month with email marketing"

### Offer Components

1. **Quantifiable Promised Result**
   - What specific result?
   - What do they GET?

2. **Specific Time Period**
   - How fast?

3. **Risk Reversal**
   - What if you don't deliver?

4. **Evidence**
   - Who else have you done this for?

### Example Offers

✅ "I guarantee I can make your e-commerce brand an additional $30K/month in revenue within 60 days—you only pay if and after it happens"

✅ "I will book your company 10-30 qualified sales meetings per month. You only pay for meetings that are qualified and show up"

✅ "I will get you 1 million views in 90 days or full refund"

### The Startup Trap

**Don't follow Y Combinator/VC advice.** That's for companies with $10M funding.

You're trying to:
- Cash flow
- Make profit
- Live in nice apartment
- Drive nice car
- Not feel broke

---

## Section 6: High-Volume Outreach (Step 4)

### The Tech Stack

| Function | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Domains | Pork Bun |
| Inboxes | Microsoft Outlook |
| Leads/Data | ListKit |
| Sending | Smartlead.ai |

### Daily Volumes

- Cold emails: 500/day minimum
- Cold DMs: 10-20/day

### Four Strategies That Work

**1. Service-Based Lead Magnet**
"I'll make a welcome flow for your brand completely for free"
- Display competence
- Get them on phone first
- Like a free trial

**2. Regular Lead Magnet / Case Study**
"Want to see how we helped a business similar to yours get [result]?"

**3. Low Commitment Offer**
Instead of $3K/month retainer → "$500 to build your welcome flow"

**4. Direct Pitch**
"I guarantee I can make you $30K additional revenue in 60 days or full refund"

### Rules

- Maximum 3 sentences
- Short is ALWAYS better
- Be direct—everyone knows it's a pitch
- Don't beat around the bush

## Section 7: Asset Production (Step 5)

### Required Checklist

- [ ] Video Sales Letter on website
- [ ] Value-driven YouTube videos (SEO optimized)
- [ ] LinkedIn profile (5+ posts/week)
- [ ] Twitter/X profile (5+ posts/week)
- [ ] Case studies

### Why Each Matters

**For every asset missing:** Cold outreach becomes harder
**For every asset added:** Next client is easier to sign

### The YouTube Hack

"I posted a Twitter Masterclass video 2 years ago. It still gets 60 views/day and still signs clients. Two years later."

**Process:**
1. Make Loom video (no editing needed)
2. Screen share Google Doc
3. SEO optimize (title, description, tags)
4. Post

**In B2B:** 1 client per 300-1,000 views is feasible

### Case Study Format

1. Reveal who they are (real person proof)
2. State the specific result with NUMBERS
3. Can be 3 minutes or 30 minutes
4. Video interview works best

---

## Section 8: Hiring & Systems (Step 6)

### Department Order

```
Marketing/Lead Gen → Sales → Fulfillment
(This is how clients flow)
```

### Hiring Order (Backwards)

```
Fulfillment FIRST → Sales SECOND → Marketing LAST
```

### The Biggest Illusion

**The myth:** "I'll just outsource fulfillment, sales, and lead gen as a beginner"

**Reality:** This has never worked, ever. You can't:
- Train someone on what you don't know
- Afford an expert
- Someone charging $500/month isn't an expert

### When to Hire Fulfillment

All three must exist simultaneously:
1. You're at $10-20K/month
2. You're at 8-10/10 busy level
3. You know how to do the fulfillment

### First Hire Profile

- VA from Philippines, Lebanon, Eastern Europe, Africa, South America
- $6-9/hour
- Repetitive tasks only
- Use Upwork or onlinejobs.ph

### What to Do With Bought Time

**Reallocate to lead gen and sales.** Don't just rest—the time you bought must create more revenue to afford better hires.

## Section 9: Funnels & Paid Ads (Step 7)

### Prerequisites

- 8-18 months in
- $50-80K/month
- Profit margins 60-80%
- $100K liquid cash
- 80% removed from fulfillment
- Closers consistently closing

### The Simple VSL Funnel

```
Ad → Opt-in (name/email/phone) → VSL Page → Book Call → Client

Non-bookers get:
- Email follow-ups
- Calls/texts from setters
- Target: $200 cost per qualified call
```

### The Self-Liquidating Funnel

```
Ad → $7-$100 Course → Order Bumps → Upsells → Qualifies for High-Ticket

Target: 1x ROAS (break even)
Benefit: Buyers are higher quality leads
```

### The Dunning-Kruger Curve
