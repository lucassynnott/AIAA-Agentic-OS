## Section 1: Turn Your Business Into an Offer

### The Offer Equation

```
OFFER = Transformation + Risk Reversal + Evidence
       (10%)           (10%)           (80%)
                         ↓
                  = Sales Velocity
```

### The Weighting Reality

| Component | Weight | What It Is |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Transformation | 10% | Specific promised result |
| Risk Reversal | 10% | What happens if you fail |
| Evidence | 80% | Proof you've done this before |

### Decision Matrix

**No case studies?** → Must have risk reversal/guarantee (minimum 20% of equation)

**Don't want guarantee?** → Must have maximum case studies (need 80%)

### Action Steps

1. Ask clients for results you've generated
2. Vehemently track all client results
3. Turn results into case studies
4. Post case studies on website
5. Create sales assets from case studies

### Proof It Works

- Agan: $0 → $83K/month in 14 months using this equation
- Tim: New offer signed 3 people in 24 hours

## Section 2: Make a Video Sales Letter

### The Guarantee

"I absolutely guarantee you that a video on your website will dramatically and immediately increase your lead flow."

**Example:** Brad got a lead one day after launching VSL—hadn't even started outreach.

### Why Video Works

- 70% of population consumes info better via video
- Without video: Leaving 70%+ of leads on table
- With video: Organic leads even without outreach

### VSL Script Framework

1. **Promise/Transformation:** What specific result?
2. **What will they get:** Exactly what's included
3. **How long:** Timeframe
4. **Who else:** Case studies/proof
5. **How do you do it:** Process explanation
6. **Why is it better:** Differentiation
7. **What if no results:** Risk reversal

### Production Rules

**You do NOT need:**
- Professional video editor
- Professional camera
- Professional microphone

**You can use:**
- iPhone
- Loom screen share
- OBS screen share

**What matters:** What you SAY, not how it looks

## Section 3: Send Cold Messages

### The Three Sequences

**Sequence 1: Warm (Your Followers)**
- DM all followers on all social channels
- Immediate, low effort

**Sequence 2: Cold Email (Automated)**
- High volume automated campaigns
- 6,000-10,000+ emails

**Sequence 3: Cold DMs (Manual)**
- Direct messages to cold leads on LinkedIn/Instagram

### Real Campaign Results

| Emails | Calls | Cost/Call |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| 6,118 | 52 | $7.06 |
| 8,400 | 33 | $15.39 |
| 8,600 | 30 | $7.26 |

**ListKit scaled to $1.3M ARR** in 3 months sending 10K cold emails/day.

---

## Section 4: Create Sales Assets

### The Flywheel

```
Direct Outreach → Sign Clients → Get Results → Create Case Studies
       ↑                                              ↓
       ←←←←←←← Sales Assets Sign More Clients ←←←←←←←
```

### What Is a Sales Asset?

Content that simultaneously:
1. Generates traffic
2. Converts traffic

### The Two-Asset Formula

From ONE client result, create:
1. **Case Study:** "How I [result] for [type of client] in [timeframe]"
2. **Swipe File:** "The exact [thing] I used to [result]"

### Distribution System

1. Post video on YouTube (SEO optimized)
2. Create carousel explainer → Post on LinkedIn (link to YouTube)
3. Create Twitter thread → Link to YouTube
4. Inside YouTube video: 30-second pitch linking to website/VSL

**Repeat to infinity.** Each asset compounds.

## Section 5: Hire Fulfillment Team

### Why You Can't Grow

"You have so many clients you have no time to actually grow the business."

### What Must Exist

1. **SOPs** on how to fulfill services
2. **Scorecards** assigning tasks to people
3. **Systems** auto-assigning tasks on triggers
4. **Automation** eliminating repetitive work

### System Example

```
Client Signs
    ↓
Create Trello Board (automated)
    ↓
Make Task (automated)
    ↓
Assign to Team Member (automated)
    ↓
Push to Slack (automated)
    ↓
End of Day Typeform: "Did you complete tasks?"
    ↓
Track Completion
```

## Section 6: Build Sales Team

### Team Structure

**Setters:**
- Call inbound lead phone numbers
- Take inbound calls, qualify
- Manage cold outreach responses
- Also called "inbox managers"

**Closers:**
- Take qualified inbound calls
- Set follow-ups
- Work cold leads

### Compensation

Both teams: 100% commission

### KPIs

- Live inside CRM 8 hours/day
- Specific performance metrics
- Only job: Work leads

---

## Section 7: Launch Paid Ads

### When to Start

- Have money AND time
- Comfortable spending thousands/month
- Predictable client base
- Team handling fulfillment and sales

### The VSL Funnel Architecture

```
Ad → Opt-in (name/email/phone) → VSL Page → Application → Book Call → Client

Non-converters:
├── Email List (daily emails)
├── Retargeting Ads → Back to Application
└── Setters (call/text) → Sales Call
```

**Run 10+ of these funnels** with different VSLs and ads.

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Cost per opt-in | $15 |
| Cost per call | $200 |
| Cost per qualified call | $400 |
| Qualified call close rate | 20% |
| CAC | $2,000 |

### The ROI Math

```
$400 × 5 calls to close 1 = $2,000 CAC
If LTV = $10,000 → 5x return
```

---

## Section 8: Increase Lifetime Value

### The Two Levers

1. Decrease CAC (limited ceiling)
2. Increase LTV (unlimited ceiling)

**Higher leverage:** Always LTV

### The Product Line Playbook

| Stage | Offer Type | Target |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| First | Done-for-you | $50-80K/month |
| Second | Done-with-you / Consulting | +$100K/month |
| Third | Low-ticket self-liquidator | Scale |

### Self-Liquidating Mechanics

```
Ad → $97 Course → Client pays $97
                  Your cost to acquire: ~$97-130
                  = 70-100% ad cost recovered
                  = Lower effective cost per lead
                  + Buyers are higher quality
```

### LTV Insurance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Client Takes In-House**
- Would have churned completely (LTV = 0)
- Sell Consulting on how to do it right
- New LTV: +$5,000-$10,000

**Scenario 2: Can't Afford Done-For-You**
- Would be unqualified (LTV = 0)
- Downsell to Consulting
- New LTV: $1,000-$8,000

**Scenario 3: Course Buyer Wants More**
- Bought $100 course
- Upsell to agency service
- New LTV: $100 → $8,100

**Scenario 4: Lost Deal Buys Course**
- Didn't close on call
- Gets emails/retargeting
- Buys course later
- LTV: $0 → $500-$1,000

### The Retention Equation

```
Client Retention = Results (50%) + Communication (50%)
```

**Key insight:** If client becomes FRIENDS with your client success manager, churn decreases by 50%.

**KPI:** Track each CSM's personal churn rate.
