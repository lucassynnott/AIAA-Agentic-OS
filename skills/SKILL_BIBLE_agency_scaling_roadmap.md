## Executive Summary

72% of businesses deal with leads. This roadmap provides the exact 5-phase system to scale from $1M to $10M per year through habits, funnel building, systems creation, team hiring, and continuous optimization.

---

## Phase 1: Fix Your Habits

> "If you want to get to $10 million per year, you have to be a $10 million per year person."

### Habit 1: Time Blocking

**Schedule:**
- Wake up: 6:00 AM or earlier
- Block calendar: Until 12:00 PM
- Focus: Customer acquisition (highest leverage work)
- Frequency: 6 days per week

**Method:**
- Set 60-minute timer
- Work on: Paid ads, content, outreach
- Repeat 4 times before noon

**Objection Handling:**
> "I've been doing it for 8-9 years. I can't think of a single time where anything bad actually happened."

- Can still check phone for emergencies
- Clients won't churn
- Team won't collapse

### Habit 2: Work Form + Accountability

**After every hour of work, fill out form:**
- Date and hour
- What you did
- Reaffirm top 5 goals
- Reaffirm standard of working (10 hours/day)

**On submit:** Email sent to accountability group (business partners, best friends, spouse, parents)

**The Hack:**
> "Have your accountability group send it back to you. Creates friendly competition and constant reminders."

**Goal:** 10 hours of work × 6 days per week

### Habit 3: Weekly Plan

**Every Sunday night:**
1. List habits
2. Define Daily Five (5 most important tasks)
3. Plan team's tasks
4. List chores

**Execution:**
- Start at top
- Go line by line
- Complete every task
- Don't do anything not on the predetermined list

### Habit 4: Metrics Tracking

**Track in one dashboard (one click access):**
- Inputs (ad spend, new creatives, YouTube videos)
- Results (leads, calls, closes)
- Client metrics

**Why:**
> "When it says zero, you can no longer ignore it like you can when you aren't tracking."

**Rule:** No guessing. No "around." No "I think." Just numbers.

### Habit 5: Energy Management

**View all decisions through lens of energy:**
- Will this food give more or less energy?
- Will this workout give more or less energy?

**Full energy optimization:**
- Diet and supplements
- Exercise
- Public accountability
- Prayer/meditation
- Big compelling goals

## Phase 4: Hire the Team

### Hiring Sequence

| Inbox Manager | Start cold outreach | Day 1 of outreach |
| Outbound Setters | Figured out messaging yourself | After you've tested what works |
| Thumbnail Designer | YouTube consistent | Day 1 of YouTube |
| Inbound Setters | 8+ inbound leads/day | Worth full-time person |
| Closer | 25+ calls/week | Closers won't work for less |
| Partnership Manager | ~$200K/month | Enough social proof/scale |
| Content Repurposer | 3x YouTube/week | Consistent output |
| Content Assistant | 3x YouTube/week | Need idea generation |
| Creative Strategist | Profitable ad funnel | After YOU figured it out |
| Media Buyer | Far along in scaling | When not good use of your time |

| Video Editor | After 100 YouTube videos | Develop skills first |
| Client Success Manager | 12+ clients AND 25+ calls/week | Both criteria met |

### Key Hiring Principles

**Admin Assistant:**
> "Buy back your time as soon as possible."

**Outbound Setters:**
> "Can't rely on setters to figure it out. Figure it out yourself first, then replicate by scaling labor horizontally."

**Closers:**
> "No closer worth their salt will work full-time if you can't consistently book them 25 calls per week."

**Video Editor:**
> "Don't hire until you've made 100 YouTube videos. Develop basic skills first. Editor is gasoline on fire, not fire starter."

## Phase 5: More → Better → New

### The Formula

1. **MORE** until it doesn't work anymore
2. **BETTER** until that doesn't work anymore
3. **NEW** - try something different

### Applied to Each Channel

| Channel | More | Better | New |
|---------|------|--------|-----|
| Paid Ads | More creatives, more funnels, more spend | Better creatives, better targeting | New platforms, new angles |
| YouTube | More videos/week, longer length | Better hooks, better content | New content types |
| Written Content | More posts/day | Better copy, better engagement | New platforms |
| Newsletter | More sends/week | Better content, better CTAs | New segments |
| Cold Email | 50K/day instead of 5K | Better copy, better targeting | New angles, new offers |
| LinkedIn | More accounts, more messages | Better messaging | New approach |
| Prospecting | More time, more setters | Better qualification | New methods |
| Partnerships | More outreach, more managers | Better pitches | New partnership types |
| Media | More podcasts, guest posts, interviews | Better content | New media types |

## The Three Agency Models to $10M

### Model 1: Factory Approach

**Math:**
- $5K/month × 166 clients × 12 months = $10M/year

**Requirements:**
- ≤10% monthly churn
- 10+ qualified leads/day
- 75%+ client success rate
- $5K+/month pricing

**Example (Matthew's Agency):**
- 49 CRO clients × $9.5K avg = $465K/month
- 77 white label partners × $5K = $385K/month
- Total: $850K MRR = $10.2M/year

**NOT for you if:**
- Can't get <10% churn
- Can't generate 10 leads/day
- <75% clients get results
- Can't charge $5K+/month

### Model 2: Ultra High Ticket

**Math:**
- $300K+ LTV/year = 33 clients for $10M

**Requirements:**
- $25K+/month per client
- Strong network
- Strong personal brand
- Can handle long sales cycle

**Best For:**
- Lead gen for high-value industries
- Affiliate offers
- Info/coaching
- Enterprise services

**Critical Understanding:**
> "You're not dealing with the founder. You're dealing with head of marketing who can be FIRED if they hire you and you screw up."

**Perception matters as much as results.** No one gets fired for hiring the leading provider.

### Model 3: Performance Only

**Key Word:** PERFORMANCE

**Only works if:** Your service actually gets results

**Model:**
- You take the risk (pay for ads/infrastructure yourself)
- Sell leads or results at performance pricing
- No retainers, no meetings, just lead seller

**Example:**
- Lead gen for financial advisors
- Instead of $5K/month retainer
- You spend the ad money, sell leads at $200/each

**Best For:**
- Services that provide "unlimited" value
- When you provide $50K value for $5K fee

> "In my view, the end of all agencies is a performance-only model."

### Model Selection Matrix

| If This Is True | Choose This Model |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Can get <10% churn, 10 leads/day, 75% success, $5K+ price | Factory |
| Have strong network/brand, can charge $25K+/month | Ultra High Ticket |
| Service gets amazing results, can take risk | Performance Only |
| None of above | Go back to drawing board |
