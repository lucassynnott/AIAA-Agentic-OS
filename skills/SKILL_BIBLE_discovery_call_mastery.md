## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Discovery is the most important part of the sales call. A perfect pitch with weak discovery loses to a mediocre pitch with excellent discovery.

1. Qualify the prospect
2. Understand their situation
3. Uncover real pain
4. Create urgency
5. Gather closing ammunition

**The Discovery Ratio**: Prospect talks 70%, you talk 30%.

## 2. THE BULLETPROOF DISCOVERY STRUCTURE

### The 7 Pillars

**Pillar 1: Current Situation**
- "Tell me about your business"
- "What's working well right now?"
- "How long have you been doing this?"

**Pillar 2: Goals & Aspirations**
- "Where do you want to be in 12 months?"
- "What does success look like?"

**Pillar 3: Pain Points**
- "What's stopping you from getting there?"
- "What have you tried before?"
- "What didn't work?"

**Pillar 4: Cost of Inaction**
- "How long has this been a problem?"
- "What happens if nothing changes?"
- "What's this costing you?"

**Pillar 5: Decision Process**
- "If this makes sense, what's the process to move forward?"
- "Anyone else involved in the decision?"

**Pillar 6: Budget**
- "Have you set aside budget for solving this?"
- "What kind of investment makes sense given the ROI?"

**Pillar 7: Timeline**

## 3. QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES

### Open-Ended Questions

Start with open questions that encourage talking:
- "Tell me about..."
- "Walk me through..."
- "Help me understand..."

### Follow-Up Depth

**The "Tell Me More" Technique**:
- Prospect: "We tried cold email and it didn't work"
- You: "Tell me more about that. What happened?"

**The "Why" Ladder**:
- Keep asking "why" to get to root cause
- Usually takes 3-5 levels

**Quantify It**:
- "You said it's a big problem. On a scale of 1-10?"
- "What's this costing you in real dollars?"

### The Mirror Technique

Repeat last 1-3 words as a question:
- Prospect: "We've been struggling with lead flow"
- You: "Lead flow?"
- Prospect: [elaborates more]

## 4. ACTIVE LISTENING

### Show You're Listening

- "I hear you saying..."
- "So what you're telling me is..."
- "It sounds like..."

### Take Notes

- Capture specific numbers
- Note exact phrases they use
- Record pain points verbatim
- These become ammunition for close

### Reflect Emotion

- "That sounds frustrating"
- "I can see why that would be concerning"
