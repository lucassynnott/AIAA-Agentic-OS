# SKILL BIBLE: Hiring & Training A-Players (First 30 Days System)

> Source: Matthew Larsen (1000x Leads)
> Context: 5 habits for training new hires in first 30 days - from 125+ hires experience

---

## Executive Summary

The first 30 days determine whether a hire becomes an A-player or a liability. This system combines onboarding courses, daily one-on-ones, planned habits, start-stop-keep feedback, and the duplication method. Bonus: The same course you build for training can be sold externally.

## The 5 First-30-Day Habits

| Habit | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Onboarding (course + assignments + feedback) | Throughout | Build skills |
| Daily one-on-ones | Daily → Weekly | Build rapport + feedback |
| Daily 5 (planned tasks) | Daily | Define expectations |
| Start-Stop-Keep | Daily → Weekly | Course correction |
| Duplication Method | As needed | Verify training worked |

## Habit 1: Onboarding System

### The Three Components

**1. Course (Learning Material)**
- Video SOPs for every part of their job
- Step-by-step guides
- Examples
- Modules organized by skill area

**Example for Cold Email Role:**
- List building module
- Offer creation module
- Script writing module
- Deliverability module
- Appointment setting/inbox management module
- Setup module

> "Think of it as one big list of all your video SOPs, prepackaged in an intentional way so they can actually learn from it."

**2. Assignments (Proof of Progress)**

After each module, practical assignments:
- List building → "Make me a list of this target market"
- Offers → "Make me an offer for X demographic"
- Scripts → "Write a script for that offer"

**The 30-Day Probation Test:**
> "If they're not progressing after 30 days and they're just absolutely terrible at it, probably not a good fit. That probation period should end in they don't work here anymore."

**3. Feedback (Correction)**

Sources:
- You (or founder)
- Peers in their department
- Their supervisor

Feedback on:
- Assignment quality
- Where they need access
- What they don't understand

### The Kill-Two-Birds Bonus

> "If you do this in an intentional and high-quality way, you can repackage all of this and sell it as an external course - one of your offers."

**Result:** Same content serves:
1. Internal training
2. External product (for unqualified leads)

## Habit 2: Daily One-on-Ones

### Who They Meet With

| Person | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| You (founder) | Strategic alignment |
| Each department member | Team chemistry |
| Supervisor | Direct feedback |

### Why Daily (First 30 Days)

**Build Rapport:**
> "The biggest hurdle for bad team chemistry or culture is they just don't know each other."

**Example Rotation:**
- 10 members in department
- 10-minute one-on-one per person
- Different person each day
- Full rotation every 2 weeks

### What They Discuss

- Progress on assignments
- Where they need access
- What they don't understand
- What's working/not working

### After 30 Days

Switch to weekly (forever).

## Habit 3: The Daily 5

### The Structure

**First 1-2 Hours:** Recurring habits (non-negotiable)
**Remaining Hours:** One-off tasks (builds business forward)

### Why Habits First

> "No matter what they get done in hours 3-8, those habits are always first priority. Those habits always get done."

### Cold Email Role Example

| Habit | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Inbox check | All replies responded to |
| Campaign check | All campaigns delivering |
| List status | Do we need to scrape another list? |
| Analytics review | Do we need new scripts? |

### Planning Rule

**You define the habits in first 30 days.**

After 30 days:
- They know their habits
- Habits are in their calendar
- Supervisor/team assigns one-off tasks in project management tool

### What Habits Should Be

> "Anything you do already as the founder. Part of why you hire is to buy back your time."

---

## Habit 4: Start-Stop-Keep (Alex Hormozi Method)

### The Framework

Daily message at end of day:

| Category | What It Is |
|----------|------------|
| **START** | Things they should begin doing |
| **STOP** | Things they should stop doing |
| **KEEP** | Things they're doing well |

### Examples

**START:**
- "Start doing 20 minutes of QA on each list before export"
- "Start looking at first two pages of contacts - if 80% aren't ICP, rebuild the list"
- "Start responding within 5 minutes during the day"

**STOP:**
- "Stop taking 30 minutes to respond"
- "Stop exporting lists without verification"

**KEEP:**
- "Keep doing a great job writing these scripts"
- "Keep up the response time on inbox management"

### Frequency Schedule

| Period | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Days 1-30 | Daily |
| Day 31+ | Weekly (forever) |

> "Friday evening I do start-stop-keep for every employee."

### As You Scale

- Too many employees to do personally?
- Managers do it for their team
- You do it for managers only
- Top-down approach

---

## Habit 5: The Duplication Method

### The Core Principle

> "They called it the duplicate method. Basically: document/create an SOP of everything you do. Think of it as one big checklist."

### The Checklist Test

**The Rule:**
> "You should be able to do the task 100% with ONLY the checklist. If you cannot, it's not a proper checklist."

If you need background knowledge or nuance that's in your brain but not in the checklist → FIX THE CHECKLIST.

### The 4-Step Process

**Step 1:** Create the checklist/SOP

**Step 2:** Do the task in front of them using ONLY the checklist

**Step 3:** They do the task in front of you using ONLY the checklist

**Step 4:** If quality matches → they are trained

> "This is the essence of training. When you hear people say 'you got to train your employees,' this is what they mean."

---

## Why This System Reduces Churn

### The Reality

> "The best employees can choose where they work. They don't have to work for you. You're not doing them a favor. You need the best employees more than they need you."

### What This System Provides

1. **Better employees** - Actually trained
2. **Faster usefulness** - Clear expectations from day 1
3. **Higher engagement** - Built-in feedback loops
4. **Better first impression** - Professional onboarding

### The Cost of Turnover

> "It's very expensive to hire good employees in terms of money AND time investment."

**Prevent churn by:**
- Making them competent quickly
- Building relationships early
- Giving constant feedback
- Showing you're invested in their success
