## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your list quality determines campaign success. The best copy and offer fail with a bad list. Garbage in, garbage out.

**The List Equation**:
```
Response Rate = (Targeting Accuracy × Data Quality × Timing) / List Saturation
```

**Key Metrics**:
- Bounce rate: <5% target
- Response rate benchmark varies by list quality
- Contact accuracy: 90%+ verified
