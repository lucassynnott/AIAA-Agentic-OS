## Executive Summary

A-players are 5-10x better than average employees, but don't cost 5-10x more. The secret to scaling an agency is paying 50% more for someone 5x better and letting them do their job. This skill bible provides the complete hiring system from job posting to 30-day onboarding.

## The Golden Hiring Principles

### Principle 1: Pay More for Better People

> "Pay 50% more for someone who is five times better and just let them do it."

**Math:**
- 1 A-player > 5-10 average employees
- Cost: Only 20-50% more (not 5-10x)

### Principle 2: The Stupid Rules Test

> "If you have to start making up stupid rules, you've hired the wrong people."

**Examples of Stupid Rules:**
- "Don't give away 50% of revenue to referral partners"
- "Don't take down the site that's getting $70K in ads"
- "Don't watch Netflix while working"

**If you need these rules:** Fire and rehire.

### Principle 3: Hire at 70% Capacity

**Trigger:** When you're at 70% capacity, start hiring

**Example:**
- You can do 10 clients yourself
- At 7 clients, start hiring
- Don't wait until you're at 100% (too late)

## The 6-Step Hiring System

### Step 1: Create Job Description

**Include:**
- Working hours (specific)
- Language requirements
- Time zone (max 3 hours difference if synchronous work)
- Pay (always show it)

**Required from applicants:**
1. **2-3 minute video** introducing themselves
   - For salespeople: Tell their funniest story
   - Test charisma and communication
   - Best hires = you laugh out loud
   
2. **Portfolio/proof of past work**
   - Filters out 50% with no skills
   - Even fake screenshots show they know what to look for

**Goal:** Auto-disqualify 90%+ of applicants

### Step 2: Post Everywhere

**Priority Order:**
1. Personal brand (YouTube, Twitter) - Fans will admire you more
2. LinkedIn
3. Indeed
4. All other job sites

**Critical:** Link all to ONE form (TypeForm/Google Form)
- Consolidate all applications
- Don't manage across platforms

**Target:** ~1,000 applications quickly

### Step 3: Choose 10 to Interview

**Move FAST:**
> "A-players can get a new job anywhere quickly. We need A-players more than they need us."

**Selection criteria:** Did they follow instructions? (video, portfolio)

**Interview Insight:**
> "Put emphasis on selecting people who you learn something from in the interview."

If you're not learning from them → They're not the right candidate

### Step 4: Paid Assignment (3 People)

**Give to top 3 candidates:**
- Pay their hourly rate (e.g., $200K/year = $100/hour)
- 4-hour assignment = $400

**Requirements:**
- Standardized assignment (can compare all 3)
- Clear deadline (≤48 hours)
- Not too laid out (want to see how they think)

**Evaluate:**
- Quality
- Timeliness
- Effort
- Creativity

**Don't DQ runners-up yet** - Keep as backup or future hires

### Step 5: 30-Day Onboarding Course

**Platform:** Thinkific, Kajabi, Circle, etc.

**Content:**
- Standards
- Culture
- Access
- Responsibilities
- SOPs

**First 3 Days: Full-Time Culture**
- 8 hours/day of culture training

> "You have to force your culture onto them. They don't get to bring their culture with them."

**Days 4-30: Systems Training**
- 1-2 hours/day
- Video course on how to do the role
- No manual teaching required

### Step 6: Training Method

**"Do It For Them, Then They Do It For You"**

1. You do the task in front of them on Zoom (using only the checklist)
2. They do the task in front of you (using only the checklist)
3. If anything's not in checklist → Add it

**Repeat for each deliverable/responsibility**

**During First 30 Days:**
- Daily 1-on-1 (15+ min)
- 1-on-1 with every team member (5-10 min)
- 1-on-1 with direct superior

### Phase 1: Early Stage ($0-$50K MRR)

| Role | When to Hire | Trigger |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Virtual Assistant | Bills covered | Making $8K/month when need $5K |
| Fulfillment Hire #1 | 70% capacity | Can do 10 clients, have 7 |
| Fulfillment Hire #2 | 70% capacity | 14 clients with 2 people |
| Fulfillment Hire #3 | 70% capacity | ~$50K MRR |
| Director of Operations | $50K MRR | Get yourself OUT of operations |

|------|--------------|---------|
| Sales Rep #1 | 25 calls/week | Taking 5 calls/day |
| Appointment Setter | Cold email running OR 10 leads/week | Need inbox management |
| Thumbnail Designer | 100 YouTube videos | After developing your skills |
| Video Editor | 100 YouTube videos | Same as thumbnail |

**Sales Rep Scaling:**
- Month 1: You take 25 calls, rep takes 7
- Month 2: You take 25 calls, rep takes 15
- At 40-50 total calls: Hire second rep
- After 2 reps: You're out of sales

### Phase 3: Scale Stage ($200K+ MRR)

| Role | When to Hire | Trigger |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Director of Marketing | Profitable ads + Working outreach + Regular content | All three working |
| Sales Rep #3-4 | 70% capacity | Repeat the process |
| Director of Sales | 4 sales reps | ~100 calls/week |

**Director of Marketing Warning:**
> "Most people get this completely backwards. They hire director of marketing to figure out ads, outreach, and content. Those are FOUNDER roles."

Director of Marketing manages and scales. YOU figure it out first.

### Phase 4: CEO Stage ($3M+ ARR)

**Executive Team Required:**
- CFO (Chief Financial Officer)
- COO (Chief Operating Officer)
- CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)
- CRO (Chief Revenue Officer)

**Hiring Rule:**
> "Hire someone who has done 3x as big as you."

| Your Revenue | Hire From |
|--------------|-----------|
| $3M/year | Someone from $9M/year agency |
| $10M/year | Someone from $30M/year agency |
| $30M/year | Someone from $100M/year agency |

**Why 3x:**
- Less than 3x: Don't know enough to help
- More than 10x: Too out of touch with your problems
