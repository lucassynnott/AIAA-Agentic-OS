## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Every objection falls into one of 5 categories. Master the principle, not canned responses. Objections are buying signals—they're still engaged.

**The 5 Real Objections**:
1. Money (price/budget)
2. Time (not now)
3. Trust (belief in you/method)
4. Authority (need others' approval)
5. Need (fit concerns)

## 2. THE OBJECTION FRAMEWORK

### 4-Step Process

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
- Don't argue
- "I totally understand..."
- "That makes sense..."

**Step 2: Clarify**
- Get to the real objection
- "Just so I understand, is it X or is there something else?"

**Step 3: Address**
- Handle with appropriate technique
- Provide proof/logic

**Step 4: Confirm & Re-Close**
- "Does that address your concern?"
- "With that handled, are you ready to move forward?"

## 3. MONEY OBJECTIONS

### "It's too expensive"

**What it means**: They don't see value exceeding cost.

**Response**:
```
"I understand—it's a significant investment.

Can I ask—what are you comparing it to?

[Listen]

The way I think about it: if this generates [X result], what's that worth over 12 months?

Based on what you shared, if we get you even [conservative result], that's a [X]x return.

Does the math make sense?"
```

### "I don't have the budget"

**Response**:
```
"Got it. Is it that budget isn't available at all, or that it's not allocated for this?

[If not allocated]

What would need to happen to prioritize this?

[If truly not available]

When would budget be available? Let's plan for that."
```

### "Can you do it for less?"

**Response**:
```
"I appreciate you asking. Our pricing reflects the value and results we deliver.

What I can do is [payment plan / adjusted scope / extra value] if that helps.

But I've found that when we discount, both parties end up compromising on the outcome."
```

## 4. TIME OBJECTIONS

### "I need to think about it"

**What it means**: Something is unresolved, or they want to avoid saying no.

**Response**:
```
"Totally fair. Just so I can help—what specifically do you need to think about?

Is it the investment, the timing, or something about how we'd work together?"

[Get to real objection, then handle that]
```

### "Not the right time"

**Response**:
```
"I hear you. What would need to change for it to be the right time?

[Listen]

And how much longer are you willing to deal with [their pain] in the meantime?

What's that costing you every month you wait?"
```

### "I'm too busy"

**Response**:
```
"I get it—you're swamped.

But here's the thing: you're busy BECAUSE you don't have this solved.

What we do actually saves you [X hours/week]. So the question is: can you afford NOT to do this?"
```

## 5. TRUST OBJECTIONS

### "I've been burned before"

**Response**:
```
"I'm sorry to hear that. That's frustrating.

Can you tell me what happened?

[Listen]

I appreciate you sharing that. Here's how we're different: [specific difference].

And that's why we offer [guarantee]—to make sure you don't feel burned again."
```

### "How do I know this will work?"

**Response**:
```
"Fair question.

Here's what I can show you: [case study of similar client].

They were in a similar situation—[their situation]. And we got them [specific result].

I can't guarantee identical results, but I can guarantee [what you can guarantee]."
```

### "I need to do more research"

**Response**:
```
"Totally understand.

What specifically do you want to research?

[Listen]

Is there anything I can help answer right now to save you time?

[Address their specific concerns]"
```

## 6. AUTHORITY OBJECTIONS

### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse"

**Response**:
```
"Of course.

What would they need to know to feel good about this?

[Listen]

Would it help if I prepared a summary you could share with them? Or would they want to jump on a quick call?"
```

### "I need to run this by my team"

**Response**:
```
"Makes sense.

What do you think their main concerns would be?

[Listen]

And if it were 100% your decision, would you move forward?"

[If yes, prepare them to sell internally]
```

---

## 7. NEED OBJECTIONS

### "I'm not sure this is right for us"

**Response**:
```
"Help me understand—what specifically concerns you about the fit?

[Listen]

Is it [specific thing] or something else?

[Address specific concern with relevant proof]"
```

### "We're different"

**Response**:
```
"Tell me more about that.

[Listen]

Actually, we've worked with [similar situation] before. [Case study].

What specifically makes you feel your situation is different?"
```

## 8. ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### The Isolate

After handling: "If it weren't for that one thing, would you be ready to move forward?"

### The Hypothetical

"Let's say you think about it and decide yes—what would that decision be based on?"

### The Reverse

"What would make you absolutely confident this is the right move?"

### The Takeaway

"Honestly, based on what you're saying, maybe this isn't right for you. What do you think?"
