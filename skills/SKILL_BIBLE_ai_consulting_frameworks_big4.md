# SKILL BIBLE: AI Consulting Frameworks (Big Four Methods)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the four key consulting frameworks used by Big Four firms (Deloitte, PWC, EY, KPMG) to reliably move the needle for clients, adapted for AI consultants. These frameworks allow you to stop competing on price and start competing on business insight and strategy.

**Core Insight:** "AI in these organizations is treated as the least important part of the AI consulting service. AI hasn't made anything possible that wasn't possible before—it has only increased efficiency. The only real leverage is applying AI to pre-existing business flows that are already producing measurable capital."

Two meta-takeaways: (1) Most AI consulting principles are just consulting, and (2) Consulting is really just thinking—the best consultants are the best thinkers.

## 1. Framework 1: Driver Trees

### What It Is
A systematic way of identifying the drivers behind a business problem by listing your goal and reverse-engineering to find what actually moves that goal forward.

### Why It Matters
Most newbies take client problems at face value:
- Client says: "Our ads aren't working"
- Newbie response: Immediately pitch ad solutions

**The problem**: There's a difference between stated needs and implicit needs. You lose the forest for the trees AND lose money.

### The Process

**Step 1: Define Goal in Simplest Terms**
Be specific with three components:
- Metric (what you're measuring)
- Amount (how much change)
- Time period (by when)

**Example**: "Double topline revenue in the next year"
- Metric: Revenue
- Amount: 2x
- Time period: 12 months

**Step 2: Identify Minimum Essential Drivers**
Aim for 2-4 major drivers. More = overcomplicating.

Use Occam's Razor: Simplest answer is probably right.

**Example drivers for doubling revenue**:
1. Get more customers
2. Increase lifetime value of existing customers

**Step 3: Drill Down One Layer Deeper**

| Driver | Sub-drivers |
|--------|-------------|
| Get more customers | Put offer in front of more people (marketing) |
| | Increase conversion rate (sales) |
| Increase LTV | Reduce churn (retention) |
| | Increase product cost (pricing) |

**Step 4: Drill Down Again (If Necessary)**

| Sub-driver | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Put offer in front of more people | Create more content |
| | Improve engagement/virality |
| Increase conversion rate | Optimize sales process |
| | Improve qualification |

### Real Example: Aar from Maker School

**Client stated need**: "We need more leads"

**Driver tree analysis**:
- Goal: Increase revenue without adding sales reps
- Drivers: Lead quantity, lead quality, conversion efficiency

**Finding**: Company had massive database. Lead quantity wasn't the issue.

**Real bottleneck**: Lead quality. Reps spent hours researching each account.

**Solution built**: End-to-end enrichment system
- Input: Company website
- Output: 50 fields auto-enriched into Salesforce
- Result: Reps get complete profiles and AI insights immediately

**Outcome**: Solved the real problem, not the stated problem.

## 2. Framework 2: Business Acumen (The Three Formulas)

### The Reality Check
"Customers don't care about the fancy technology. What they care about are the outcomes you are driving."

As AI service providers, we care about:
- API calls
- Models to use
- Platforms to integrate
- Node configurations

Clients care about: **Outcomes**

### The Three Business Formulas

Everything a consultant pitches should map to one of these:

#### Formula 1: Profit
```
Profit = Revenue - Costs
```

Every business decision impacts this equation. Can go deeper (gross margin, operational margin) but this is usually sufficient.

#### Formula 2: Growth
```
Growth = Acquisition + Retention + Expansion
```

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Acquisition | Bring in new customers |
| Retention | Keep existing customers |
| Expansion | Sell more to existing customers |

**Example Analysis**:
Monthly retainer with 50% monthly churn = 2-month average relationship

Options:
- Focus on acquisition (expensive, lots of effort)
- Focus on retention (much cheaper per unit work)

**Recommendation**: Fix churn first. Retention is cheaper to move than acquisition.

#### Formula 3: Value (Valuation Mindset)
```
Value = Cash Flow / Risk
```

Higher cash flow + Lower risk = Higher business value

**Example**:
Two SaaS companies, both $100K/month MRR:
- Company A: Enterprise clients, 2-year contracts
- Company B: SMBs, month-to-month

Company A is worth significantly more (lower risk).

### The AI Risk Factor
**Critical insight nobody talks about**: Sometimes AI systems INCREASE risk.

Even if cash flow increases, if risk increase offsets it, the system may not be worth it.

**Golden goose scenario**: Systems that both:
- Increase cash flow
- Decrease risk (by reducing variable human performance)

This multiplies the value equation.

### Real Example: Nick from Maker School

**Client stated need**: "We want an AI chatbot" / "We need smarter AI"

**Business acumen analysis**:
- Profit = Revenue - Costs
- Growth = Acquisition + Retention + Expansion

**Finding**: Real issue was churn, not AI sophistication.

**Solution built**: Churn prevention system
- AI personalized onboarding sequences
- Proactive 7-day and 30-day success check-ins
- Triggers flagging overwhelmed customers before they cancel

**Outcome**: Significantly improved bottom line without the requested AI chatbot.

### The Pre-Pitch Checklist
Before pitching ANY AI solution, identify which formula you're moving:
- [ ] Increasing revenue?
- [ ] Decreasing costs?
- [ ] Improving acquisition?
- [ ] Improving retention?
- [ ] Enabling expansion?
- [ ] Decreasing risk?
- [ ] Increasing risk?

**If you can't answer clearly, client probably can't either → probably shouldn't do it.**

## 3. Framework 3: Communication (Pyramid Principle)

### The Problem
You can have the best ideas, but if you can't communicate them, you and the client lose.

### The Pyramid Principle
**State conclusion first. Support with arguments after.**

Most people do it backwards:
1. Context building
2. Compelling story
3. Finally get to the point (buried lead)

By the time they reach conclusion, client has:
- Already reached their own conclusion, or
- Stopped paying attention (everyone skims)

### Example Application

**Goal**: Grow Maker School revenue 200% in 12 months

**Wrong approach** (burying the lead):
"Well, we've been thinking about growth, and there are many factors, and we've been analyzing the market, and considering different options, and ultimately we think we should..."

**Right approach** (pyramid principle):
```
To grow the revenue of Maker School by 200% in 12 months:

We can expand who pays, how much they pay, and how long they keep paying:

1. Increase customer acquisition:
   - More traffic
   - More ads
   - More partnerships
   - More content
   - Increase conversion rate

2. Increase average transaction value:
   - Introduce upsells
   - Add premium tier
   - Add private coaching
   - Offer cross-sells (templates, playbooks, bundles)

3. Increase customer lifetime value:
   - Better community ties
   - More touchpoints
   - Structured progress tracking
   - Reduce churn with accountability
```

**Start with goal → Client buys in → Then support with actions**

### Start With Problem First (In Proposals)

**Wrong approach**:
"Company X is a $5 million per year business in the XYZ industry that does blank..."

Nobody cares. Wasting space.

**Right approach**:
"Leftclick is currently spending $45,000 on customer acquisition and seeing next to no returns. This is crippling growth because you don't have that much cash flow to begin with. That makes it an existential risk."

**Problem → Resonance → Conclusions → Solutions**

Only after identifying and quantifying the problem do you focus on the solution.

## 4. Framework 4: FAST Decision-Making

### What It Is
A four-step process for any problem (business or personal) that structures thinking and stops leaving outcomes on the table.

### The Acronym

| Letter | Principle | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| F | First Principles | Strip problem to fundamentals, rebuild from ground up |
| A | Action-Oriented | Focus on what can be implemented in next 24 hours |
| S | Second Order Thinking | Consider outcomes beyond the immediate |
| T | Triangulation | Cross-reference with other data sources AFTER own thinking |

### F - First Principles

**Don't accept assumptions. Don't accept pre-imposed solutions.**

**Wrong approach**:
"We need to automate our invoicing process" (solution already assumed)

**Right approach**:
"What's the problem? What's the straightest line path to fixing it?"

→ "I want to get paid faster"
→ Use driver tree to determine where to apply effort

### A - Action-Oriented

**Bias toward doing, not planning.**

**Wrong approach**:
"Let's research all CRM options for 3 months then decide"

**Right approach**:
"Why don't we pick the top two CRM today, run them in parallel for a week trial, then decide and move forward?"

Will it be the perfect decision? Probably not.
Is it 90% of the way there in 1/10th of the time? Yes. Massive leverage.

### S - Second Order Thinking

**If this works, what happens next?**

**Wrong approach**:
"This chatbot will handle 80% of support tickets"

**Right approach**:
"If the chatbot handles 80% of support tickets, what happens next? Can we deal with that? If not, how do we implement another solution to deal with the inevitable bottleneck we're creating?"

### T - Triangulation

**Check your work AFTER doing your own thinking.**

Why last?
- Forces you to think through problem yourself first
- Conclusions won't be constrained/colored/biased by others' work
- Like doing homework yourself before checking the answer book

**Only after you have a stated hypothesis with stated solution do you check what others did.**

Result: Novel, creative solutions that drive disproportionate outcomes.

### Real Example: Maximilian's Healthcare Project

**Client request**: "Build me an AI transcription model for doctors"

**FAST Analysis**:

**First Principles**: Do we need to build a new AI model?
- Fundamental requirement: Record audio → Get accurate transcription
- Building a custom model requires: AI engineers, tons of data, massive data pipeline, hardware, servers
- Using pre-existing model: Entirely different story (simple)

**Action-Oriented**: Simple pilot test
- Voice recording → Send to existing model → Get summary
- Implemented in 1 hour
- Shows client: "Yes, this is possible"

**Second Order**: If this works, what happens?
- Company wants to implement at scale
- Medical records = HIPAA compliance matters
- Penalties for breaking compliance are severe
- Need: Local models OR secure infrastructure

**Triangulation**: Existing tools?
- Commir, Caragon already do this
- Don't reinvent the wheel

**Outcome**: Solved problem without building custom AI model.

## 5. How The Four Frameworks Work Together

### The Flow

```
1. DRIVER TREES → Identify what actually matters
        ↓
2. BUSINESS ACUMEN → Ensure you're moving the right levers
        ↓
3. COMMUNICATION → Get clients to say yes
        ↓
4. FAST → Make everything systematic and repeatable
```

### The Transformation
From: Automation builder (selling AI tools)
To: Systems consultant (helping companies think through problems systematically)

**Key insight**: "AI is just one of the many levers I could pull. The technical implementation is not what makes me most of the money—it is the way I approach business problem solving."

## 6. Practical Application Checklist

### Before Any Client Engagement

**Driver Tree**:
- [ ] What is the specific goal (metric + amount + timeframe)?
- [ ] What are the 2-4 major drivers?
- [ ] What are the sub-drivers?
- [ ] Have I validated the REAL problem vs stated problem?

**Business Acumen**:
- [ ] Which formula am I moving? (Profit/Growth/Value)
- [ ] Am I increasing revenue?
- [ ] Am I decreasing costs?
- [ ] Am I improving acquisition/retention/expansion?
- [ ] What's the risk impact?

**Communication**:
- [ ] Am I leading with the conclusion/goal?
- [ ] Am I starting with the problem?
- [ ] Is my supporting structure clear?

**FAST**:
- [ ] Have I stripped this to first principles?
- [ ] What can be done in 24 hours?
- [ ] What happens if this succeeds?
- [ ] Have I triangulated with existing solutions?

## AI PARSING GUIDE

### Primary Objective
When user presents a business problem or client request, apply the four frameworks in sequence: Driver Tree (what matters) → Business Acumen (right levers) → Communication (get buy-in) → FAST (systematic decision-making).

### Critical Decision Points

**If User Says**: "Client wants X feature/system"
**Action Sequence**:
1. Apply Driver Tree: What's the actual goal?
2. Check Business Acumen: Which formula does this move?
3. Use FAST: First principles analysis
4. Communicate: Problem → Solution structure

**If User Says**: "How do I price this project?"
**Action Sequence**:
1. Identify which Business Acumen formula it impacts
2. Calculate: Revenue impact, cost savings, or risk reduction
3. Price based on value moved, not hours worked

### Integration Points
**Connects to**:
- `SKILL_BIBLE_ai_consulting_positioning.md` - Positioning as strategist
- `SKILL_BIBLE_ai_service_pricing_premium.md` - Value-based pricing
- `SKILL_BIBLE_ai_consulting_2026_playbook.md` - Sales and delivery process

### Output Quality Standards
When applying frameworks:
1. ✅ Goal is specific (metric + amount + timeframe)
2. ✅ Drivers are limited to 2-4
3. ✅ Business formula impact is identified
4. ✅ Communication leads with conclusion/problem
5. ✅ FAST thinking is applied before triangulation

### Red Flags (Anti-Patterns)
❌ Taking client's stated need at face value
❌ Building solution without identifying driver tree
❌ Cannot answer which business formula system moves
❌ Burying the lead in communication
❌ Triangulating before doing own thinking
