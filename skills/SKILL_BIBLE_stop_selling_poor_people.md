# SKILL BIBLE: Stop Selling to Poor People (Daniel Fazio Method)

## Executive Summary

This skill bible documents the critical mindset and tactical shift required to sign better clients. The core insight: 80% of your clients getting 20% of results isn't because you're bad—it's because they run bad businesses. Poor clients warp your pricing psychology, waste your time, and destroy your confidence. The solution: aggressive filtering, authority building, and targeting qualified prospects only.

**Key Quote:** "Poor people don't have money to pay you higher prices. They leak out the pores, they leak out into your psyche and they make you poor. Just eliminate them—don't ever talk to them at all."

## Section 1: The 80/20 Problem

### The Pattern You'll See

In any portfolio of clients:
- 20% get 80% of the results
- 80% get lackluster or no results

**Your false conclusion:** "I must be bad at what I do"

**The reality:** A significant portion of bad results come from clients running bad businesses.

### Why This Matters

When most clients fail, it:
- Destroys your confidence
- Makes you scared to close
- Warps your pricing
- Creates scarcity mindset

---

## Section 2: The Pricing Psychology Trap

### How Poor People Warp Your Mind

**Scenario:**
1. You quote reasonable price ($3K/month)
2. Poor client says "Too expensive"
3. This happens on 50% of calls
4. You conclude: "I'm charging too much"
5. You lower prices
6. Rich client comes, you quote low price
7. They either think you're amateur or take the deal
8. You got swindled

### The Real Problem

You're not charging too much. You're talking to people who can't afford ANYTHING.

**To a poor person:** Everything is expensive
**To a rich person:** Reasonable prices seem cheap

## Section 3: The Type Form Filter

### The System

**Before:** Landing page → Calendly → Takes all calls

**After:** Landing page → Type Form → [Filter] → Calendly

### Filter Questions

**Question 1: Revenue**
```
"What is your current monthly revenue?"
- Less than $3,000 → REJECT (don't show calendar)
- $3,000-$10,000 → Continue
- $10,000-$30,000 → Continue
- $30,000+ → Continue
```

**Question 2: Investment Ability**
```
"Can you invest $[X] to get started?"
- Yes → Continue
- No → REJECT
```

### What Rejection Looks Like

Don't show them calendar. Message:
```
"Thanks for your application. We'll review and 
contact you if we determine we can help."
```

(You won't contact them.)

## Section 4: The Revenue Math

### Pricing vs. Client Revenue

| Your Price | Minimum Client Revenue |
|-----------|----------------------|
| $1,500/month | $5-6K/month |
| $3,000/month | $15K/month+ |
| $5,000/month | $25K/month+ |
| $10,000/month | $50K/month+ |

### The Lead Distribution Reality

Even with maximum authority (tons of content, followers, case studies):
- ~50% of leads are qualified

Without authority:
- Only ~20% of leads are qualified

### The Scarcity Math

**Example:**
- 20 leads/month
- 20% qualified = 4 qualified leads
- 4 potential buyers in entire month
- = Severe scarcity mindset
- = Desperate selling behavior

---

## Section 5: The 85/15 Rule

### What Business You're Actually In

**You think:** "I'm in the e-commerce email marketing business"

**Reality:** 85% of your work is:
- Cold outreach
- Content creation
- Personal brand building
- Ad funnels
- Follow-up
- Sales calls

**Only 15%** is actual email marketing.

### Why This Matters

Every agency and B2B business is 85% the same:
- Content marketing
- Cold outreach
- Paid ads

**That's it.** Three ways to get clients. Master them.

---

## Section 6: Attracting Better Clients

### What "Attract" Actually Means

Not: Manifest clients through positive thinking

Yes: Algorithm serves your content to matched audiences

**If you talk about beginner stuff** → Algorithm serves beginners

**If you talk about advanced stuff** → Algorithm serves advanced people

### Three Ways to Increase Authority

**1. Produce Useful Content**
- Teaching things they didn't know
- Actually actionable (not fluff)
- Posted consistently

**2. Gain Followers**
- Achieved through consistent useful content
- Creates social proof
- "If many follow, must be worth listening to"

**3. Create Case Studies**
- Quantifiable results
- Video interviews preferred
- Real names, real businesses, real numbers

---

## Section 7: Authority and Selling

### The Authority Equation

```
For a sale to occur:
Your perceived expertise ≥ Client's perceived self-expertise

If client thinks they know more than you → No sale
```

### Building Higher Authority

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Useful content | Shows expertise |
| Followers | Social proof |
| Case studies | Results proof |

### The Testimonial Problem

**Bad testimonial:** "We loved working with him"
**Good testimonial:** "He made us $50,000 in 90 days"

Nobody cares about feelings. They care about results.

---

## Section 8: Outbound Filtering

### Cold Email Targeting

Instead of emailing everyone:
- Use ListKit
- Filter: 11+ employees
- Filter: Specific revenue thresholds
- Only email qualified prospects

**Don't email poor people in the first place.**

### Dream 100 Qualification

Before adding to Dream 100 list:
- Check their website
- Estimate revenue
- Are they a real business?
- Can they afford you?

---

## Section 9: The Confidence Loop

### Negative Loop (Talking to Poor People)

```
Talk to poor people → They say "too expensive"
    ↓
Lower prices → Talk to more poor people
    ↓
Still "too expensive" → Lower confidence
    ↓
Lower prices more → Poverty mindset
    ↓
[Cycle continues down]
```

### Positive Loop (Only Qualified Prospects)

```
Filter out poor people → Only talk to qualified
    ↓
Quote fair prices → They pay
    ↓
Get results → Create case studies
    ↓
Higher authority → More qualified prospects
    ↓
Higher prices → Higher confidence
    ↓
[Cycle continues up]
```
